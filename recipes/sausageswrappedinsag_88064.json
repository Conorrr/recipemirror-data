        "For the sausages, heat the oil in a frying pan and fry the sausages for about 2-3 minutes, turning frequently, until lightly browned on all sides. Lay the slices of ham on a work surface and sprinkle with the chopped sage. Roll the sausages up in the ham and return to the pan. Fry for about ten minutes, or until completely cooked through.",
        "For the cheese-topped swede, boil the swede in salted water for about 12-15 minutes until tender. Drain and mash with the butter, pepper and a pinch of salt. Place in an ovenproof dish and top with the cheese. Grill for about 5-7 minutes, until the cheese is bubbling.",
        "To serve, place a spoonful of the swede onto a serving plate. Cut each sausage in half diagonally and arrange on top. Garnish with a sprig of rosemary."
