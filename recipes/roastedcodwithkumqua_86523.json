        "For the kumquat marmalade, place a heavy-based pan on a moderate heat, and when hot, add the sunflower oil, followed by the red onion. Fry for 2-3 minutes until the onion has softened.",
        "Add the cinnamon to the pan and continue frying for a further two minutes.",
        "Tip in the kumquats and cook for 3-4 minutes, until just beginning to soften.",
        "Add the brown sugar and pour over the vinegar.",
        "Cover, and simmer for 8-10 minutes, until the kumquats have completely softened and lost their shape.",
        "Remove the lid and continue boiling for a further 6-8 minutes until the juices have cooked down and the marmalade has thickened.",
        "Remove the pan from the heat and leave to cool.",
        "Preheat the oven to 220C/425F/Gas 7.",
        "Season the cod with salt and black pepper.",
        "Heat a frying pan until hot then add the olive oil and cod, skin-side down.",
        "Cook for two minutes then place in the oven for 5-8 minutes until cooked through.",
        "Meanwhile, to make the green pepper dressing, place the peppers and water into a food processor and blend to a pur\u00e9e.",
        "Strain the mixture through a tea towel into a clean pan.",
        "Place the pan on the heat and bring to a boil.",
        "Reduce the heat and simmer for five minutes until the mixture has thickened.",
        "Place the micro cress and fennel tops into a bowl and toss with the olive oil, salt and black pepper, to taste.",
