    "description": "This is such a simple cake - a variation on the classic lemon drizzle - and it works a treat. It has a wonderful, light texture, a very fresh taste and it looks incredibly pretty \u2013 perfect with a cuppa on a sunny afternoon. You can buy dried, edible lavender from baking suppliers and some supermarkets. Alternatively, if you have lavender growing in your garden, you can use fresh buds and leaves, finely chopped.",
