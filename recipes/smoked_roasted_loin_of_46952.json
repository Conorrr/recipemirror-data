    "steps": [
        "Season the venison with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Set the smoker alight, or light a barbecue. When the coals have turned grey, sprinkle them with wet wood chips to generate smoke.",
        "Heat a frying pan until hot, add 25g/1oz of the butter and two tablespoons of the oil and sear the venison on each side for 2-3 minutes until nearly cooked.",
        "Remove the pan from the heat and turn the venison over a couple of times, basting with the pan juices. Place the venison in the home smoker, cover and turn off the heat. Leave for five minutes. Alternatively, place in a smoke-filled barbecue, but not over the coals, for five minutes. Set aside to rest for 10 minutes.",
        "Meanwhile, heat a frying pan until hot, add another 25g/1oz butter and the remaining oil, shallot and thyme and cook gently for 2-3 minutes until just softened.",
        "Add the red wine and cook until reduced by half then add the beef stock and cook until reduced by half once more and slightly thickened.",
        "Finish with the last of the butter and the redcurrant jelly and check the seasoning.",
        "For the beetroot tarte tatin, preheat the oven to 200C/400F/Gas 6.",
        "Heat four small ovenproof blini pans until hot then divide the sugar and butter between them and cook until caramelised and slightly thickened.",
        "Divide the halves of beetroot among the blini pans, cut side down, and cook for 1-2 minutes.",
        "Cut out four circles of the pastry, each slightly larger than the circumference of the blini pans.",
        "Cover each pan with a pastry round, pushing the edge down around the beetroot. Transfer to the oven and bake for 15-20 minutes, until the pastry is golden-brown and cooked through.",
        "Remove from the oven and let cool slightly.",
        "To serve, carefully turn the tartes out onto the plate, carve the venison into thick slices and place in a pile on top. Finish with a drizzle of sauce and a spoonful of cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche."
