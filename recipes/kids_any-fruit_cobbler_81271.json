        "Adults job: preheat the oven to 200C/400F/Gas 6.",
        "Kid\u2019s job: Chop the fruit into chunks. Don\u2019t worry about the size being perfect, it is good to have a variety of chunks! (An adult should supervise this.)",
        "Kid\u2019s job: Place the fruit into an ovenproof dish and pour over the orange juice and the brown sugar.",
        "Kid\u2019s job: Place the flour into a mixing bowl and chop the butter into small lumps. They can then rub in the butter roughly using their fingertips. This doesn\u2019t have to be perfect, a few lumps are fine.",
        "Kid\u2019s job: Stir in the oats, sugar and spices to the cobbler mix and stir it through with a spoon or your hands.",
        "Kid\u2019s job: Add the yoghurt one spoonful at a time. You may need to mix with your hands to form a rough dough.",
        "Kid\u2019s job: Form the cobbler mix into small balls, about the size of a ping pong ball and arrange them over the top of the fruit.",
        "Adult\u2019s job: Place in the oven for 30-40 minutes or until the cobbler is golden-brown on top with the fruit bubbling up around the edges. Leave to cool before serving as the fruit filling will be very hot. Serve warm with ice cream, yoghurt or custard."
