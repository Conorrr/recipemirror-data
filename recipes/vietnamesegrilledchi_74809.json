    "steps": [
        "Place the chicken wings in a bowl with the lemongrass. Cover with cling film and leave to marinate for three hours.",
        "Whisk the oyster and chilli sauces together with the water and honey, then set aside.",
        "Place the chicken wings on a barbecue and grill for five minutes on each side until just cooked.",
        "Score the wings with a knife, then brush with some of the oyster sauce mixture. NB: It is important not to put the sauce on at the beginning as the sugar content is high and you will burn the wings.",
        "Place the cucumber and carrot ribbons on a plate and top with the chicken wings.",
        "Serve with a drizzle of the remaining sauce."
