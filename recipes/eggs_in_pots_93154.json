        "The cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche can be replaced with b\u00e9chamel or mornay sauce. If you like, you can add chopped mushrooms, ham, smoked salmon or cherry tomatoes after the cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche, or a spoonful of pip\u00e9rade. Try swapping the dill for parsley, basil or coriander, or spice things up with a dash of Tabasco or chilli sauce."
