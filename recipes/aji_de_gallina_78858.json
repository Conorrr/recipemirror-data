        "This dish should be mild and creamy, with just a gentle heat from the chilli and paprika. If you're able to find Peruvian aji amarillow paste, made from yellow chillies, then use 1-2 teaspoons of this in place of the green chilli, paprika and turmeric. You can also use chicken legs or thighs; for extra flavour cook them on the bone. You'll need to simmer them in stage one for 20-30 minutes, or until no trace of pinks juices run when pierced with a skewer at the thickest part. Some cooks like to add a chopped carrot and celery stick to the pan with the chicken to add flavour."

            "2 chicken breasts",
            "50g fresh white breadcrumbs",
            "200ml whole milk",
            "2-3 tbsp olive oil or vegetable oil",
            "1 large onion, chopped",
            "3 cloves garlic, chopped",
            "1 large mild green chilli, seeds removed, finely chopped",

        "Place the chicken in a saucepan, add just enough boiling water to cover, then bring to the boil and simmer for 8-10 minutes, or until opaque and cooked through. Remove from the water and set aside on a plate to cool, reserve the cooking liquor. When cool enough to handle, shred the chicken.",
        "Meanwhile, soak the breadcrumbs in the milk.",
        "Heat the oil in a large frying pan over a medium-high heat and fry the onion for 7-8 minutes, or until softened and golden. Add the garlic and chilli and fry for a further minute until fragrant. Stir in the paprika, turmeric and seasoning and fry for a minute, adding a little more oil if the mixture looks dry.",
        "Add the shredded chicken and stir to coat in the spices for a minute, then pour in the soaked breadcrumbs and milk. Add 200ml of the reserved stock, bring to a boil then lower the heat and simmer gently for five minutes. Stir in the nuts and simmer for a further 5 minutes, or until the sauce is rich and creamy, adding a little more stock if it gets too thick.",
        "Stir in the parmesan, season to taste with salt and freshly ground black pepper."
