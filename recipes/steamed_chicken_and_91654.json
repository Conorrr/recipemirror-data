        "For the filling, mix the filling ingredients together in a shallow dish and leave to marinade for half an hour.",

        "To cook the dim sum prepare a steamer. Take a plum-sized piece of dough and roll it out into a 5cm/2in diameter circle that is approximately 5mm/\u00bcin thick. Place some of the filling in the centre and fold around.",
        "Steam for 4-5 minutes until the chicken is cooked through and then serve."

    "tips": [
        "To make the spring onion oil, fry three stems of spring onion in 300ml/\u00bd pint of vegetable oil until brown. Remove from the heat and cool. Discard the spring onion and you will have a fragrant oil that can be stored in an air-tight container for other uses."
