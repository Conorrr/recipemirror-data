            "475g/1lb 1oz undyed smoked haddock fillet, cut in half",
            "2 bay leaves",
            "200g/7oz basmati rice, rinsed in cold water and drained",
            "4 free-range eggs",
            "100g/3\u00bd frozen peas (optional)",
            "40g/1\u00bdoz butter",
            "1 tbsp sunflower oil",
            "1 onion, finely chopped",
            "1 heaped tbsp medium curry powder",
            "3 tbsp double cream",
            "3 tbsp chopped fresh parsley",

    "steps": [
        "Place the haddock in a large frying pan, skin-side up. Pour over 500ml/17fl oz water, add the bay leaves and bring the water to a gentle simmer. Cook the fish for 8-10 minutes until it is just done and flakes easily. Drain in a colander set over a bowl, reserving the cooking liquor, and discard the bay leaves.",
        "Pour the cooking liquor into a medium saucepan and stir in the rice. Cover with a lid and bring to the boil. Reduce the heat and simmer the rice very gently for 10 minutes. Turn off the heat and leave the rice covered for 3-5 minutes more. By this time it should have absorbed all the fish liquor.",
        "While the rice is cooking, bring some water to the boil in a medium pan. Add the eggs and cook for eight minutes. Drain them in a sieve under cold running water and when cool enough to handle, peel them carefully and set aside. Cook the peas, if using, in a small pan of boiling water and drain.",
        "Melt the butter with the oil in a large pan and cook the onion over a low hear for five minutes until well softened, stirring occasionally. Add the curry powder and cook for another 3 minutes, stirring constantly. Place the cooked rice into the pan and stir in the onions. Add the peas, cream, parsley and a few twists of ground black pepper.",
        "Flake the fish into chunky pieces and add these to the pan. Gently stir the lemon juice and cook for 1-2 minutes. Cut the eggs into quarters and place them on the rice. Cover the pan with a lid and heat through for 2-3 minutes or until the eggs are warm, then serve.",
        "If not serving immediately, tip the kedgeree into a warm dish and dot with a few cubes of butter. Cover with foil and keep warm in a low oven for up to 20 minutes before serving."
