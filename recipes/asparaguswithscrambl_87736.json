        "Preheat the oven to 200C/350F/Gas 6.",
        "With a sharp knife, trim any woody stalks from the asparagus spears.",
        "Heat one tablespoon of the oil in an ovenproof frying pan. Add the asparagus and fry in the pan for a few minutes, before transferring to the oven to cook for 4-5 minutes until tender all the way through.",
        "Crack the eggs into a small bowl and add the chopped chives. Beat the eggs with the chives and salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste.",
        "Heat the remaining olive oil in a small frying pan over a low-medium heat, then add the eggs and stir with a wooden spoon until the eggs are just cooked. Remove from the heat.",
        "Divide the roasted asparagus between two plates. Spoon the scrambled egg next to the asparagus and serve."
