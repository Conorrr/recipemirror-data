Forget your winter boeuf bourguignon, it\u2019s so last season! Navarin d\u2019agneau printanier, a lamb stew with fresh vegetables, is what should be bubbling away in your kitchen.",

        "Heat the olive oil in a large flameproof casserole (cocotte) and brown the meat, garlic and onion. Add the bay leaf, thyme and carrots, and enough water to cover the meat by at least a couple of centimetres.",

        "Five minutes before serving add the peas and beans to the lamb. Cook until the vegetables are tender.",
        "Season with salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste, and serve straightaway."
