        "For the parmesan emulsion, Heat the fish stock, whipping cream, cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche and parmesan in a pan and bring to the boil. Leave to infuse for a few hours. Sieve the sauce and reheat before serving.",
        "For the confit tomato petals, preheat the oven to 110C/225F/Gas \u00bc.",
        "Cut the flesh from the sides of the tomatoes to make twelve rounded petal shapes.",

        "For the rice, in a frying pan heat the duck fat and beef marrow, add the shallot and fry gently without colouring.",
        "Add the rice then pour in the wine and cook for two minutes. Add the chicken stock until it just covers the rice. Once the stock is absorbed, little by little, add more stock until the rice is cooked (about 20 minutes). Season with salt, pepper and Espelette chilli, add the squid ink, then stir in the whipping cream.",

        "Place a hand blender in the emulsion and blend until foam appears.",
        "Dress the dish with the foam."
