            "\u00bc tsp freshly ground black pepper",

    "steps": [
        "Top, tail and then peel the cucumber. Cut into 1.5-2cm/\u00bein thick slices to give about 16-18 in total. Using a melon baller, small teaspoon or a \u00bc teaspoon measuring spoon, scoop out enough of the seeds from the middle to give a cup that has a border about 5mm thick, making sure you don\u2019t go right down to the bottom. Arrange them on a large platter and set aside.",
        "Break the feta cheese into a small bowl and mash it with a fork until as smooth as possible. Add the dill and season with the pepper (but no salt as feta is already salty), stirring everything together well. Divide the feta cheese mixture between the cucumber cups. Arrange a little pile of pomegranate seeds on top of each one and serve."
