        "For the pancakes, sieve the flour and salt into a bowl. Crack in the egg and gradually whisk in the milk until the mixture forms a smooth batter. Cover and leave to one side to rest for at least an hour.",
        "Heat the oil in a non-stick frying pan. Ladle in just enough batter to thinly cover the bottom of the pan. Cook for 30 seconds, or until light brown, before turning over and cooking the other side. Remove the pancake from the pan and repeat this process with the rest of the batter. Once all of the pancakes are cooked, place to one side and leave to cool.",
        "Spread each pancake with cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche and season with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Sprinkle the chives over the pancakes before topping with a thin layer of smoked salmon. Roll each pancake up into a cylinder.",
        "To serve, slice each pancake into four and arrange on a large serving plate. Finish with dressed salad leaves."
