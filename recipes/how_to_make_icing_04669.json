        "Put the butter into a large bowl and beat with an electric hand mixer until light and fluffy.",

        "Add the milk and the vanilla, then beat until creamy and smooth.",
        "If the mixture is too stiff, add a little more milk.",
        "Scrape down the sides of the bowl to make sure all the icing sugar is incorporated. Continue to whisk until light and creamy.",
