    "steps": [
        "Preheat the oven to 150C/300F/Gas 2. Grease and line a 33cm x28cm/15in x11in Swiss roll tin with silicone or greaseproof paper.",
        "Place the egg whites into a bowl and whisk until soft peaks form when the whisk is removed from the bowl. Gradually add the sugars until stiff peaks forms and the mixture is glossy. Whisk in the cornflour and cocoa until well combined.",
        "Spoon the mixture into the tin and gently smooth the surface with a palette knife. Bake in the oven for one hour. Test by pushing a skewer into the centre of the cake. If the skewer comes out clean, the cake is ready.",
        "Whisk the whipped cream, icing sugar and vanilla seeds in a bowl until soft peaks form when the whisk is removed.",
        "Dust a large piece of greaseproof paper with icing sugar.",
        "Turn the roulade out onto the paper and peel off the lining paper. Trim the two long edges.",
        "Spoon over the raspberry pur\u00e9e, then the cream and finally the cranberries. Roll up using the sheet of greaseproof paper to help you lift the meringue. Place the roulade onto a plate and dust with the icing sugar and cocoa powder.",
        "To serve, slice the roulade into thick pieces and serve with the raspberries and chocolate sauce."
