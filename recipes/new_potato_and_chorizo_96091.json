    "description": "Many countries have their own version of an open omelette. The Italians have frittata, the Spanish tortilla. In France it is Spanish omelette. Traditionally it wouldn\u2019t be new season potatoes used in this dish \u2013 it would be bigger main crop potatoes \u2013 but I wanted to celebrate the first of the early potatoes and they work surprisingly well.",

        "As the season goes on, you could substitute the Jersey Royals for Belle de Fontenay and other different varieties, such as Agria: you just don\u2019t want a potato that is too floury as it will break up. This dish offers hundreds of opportunities for interpretation using different vegetables and herbs \u2013 be as creative as you like."
