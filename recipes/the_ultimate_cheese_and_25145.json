Remove from the hob and place in a bowl, cover with cling film, and set aside. Once cool enough to handle, peel off the black skin and cut the flesh into quarters, removing the seeds.",

        "Slice off the top of the loaf of bread. Hollow out the loaf by scooping out the soft bread, leaving 3cm/1\u00bcin of bread around the edge.",
        "Fill the hollow loaf with layers of the peppers, tomatoes, courgettes, red onion, cheese and pesto, seasoning between each layer.",
        "Place the lid of the loaf back on and push down, you can wrap it in cling film and leave overnight or slice straight away."
