        "To make the champ, cook the potatoes in salted water for 5-10 minutes, until tender.",
        "Drain three-quarters of the water and continue to cook on a low heat. Avoid stabbing the potatoes with a knife, because if they're floury potatoes they'll break up if you do.",
        "When cooked, drain all the water off, peel and mash with most of the butter while hot.",
        "Meanwhile, place the milk in a saucepan with the peas and spring onion and boil for four or five minutes, until cooked.",
        "Add the parsley and take off the heat.",
        "Add the potatoes, keeping some of the milk back in case you don't need it all.",
        "Season to taste and beat until creamy and smooth, adding more milk if necessary.",
        "Serve piping hot with the remaining butter melting in the centre."
