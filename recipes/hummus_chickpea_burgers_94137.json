    "steps": [
        "Heat 1 tablespoon of the oil in a non-stick frying pan over a medium heat. Add the onion and garlic and fry gently for 4-5 minutes, or until softened, stirring regularly. Stir in the cumin and coriander and fry for 1-2 minutes, or until fragrant. Remove from the heat and set aside to cool for 5 minutes.",
        "Place in a food processor, add half of the chickpeas and all of the hummus and flour. Season with salt and pepper. Blend to a rough paste.",
        "Add the remaining chickpeas and the pine nuts. Pulse for a few seconds until the chickpeas and pine nuts have broken down but retain some texture. Season to taste.",
        "Divide the chickpea mixture into 8 portions. Roll each into a ball, flatten between your palms into a burger shape approximately 1.5cm/\u00bdin thick.",
        "Heat the remaining oil in a large, non-stick frying pan. Add the burgers in batches and fry for 3-4 minutes on each side, or until golden-brown and crisp on both sides and heated through.",
        "Serve the burgers in pitta breads stuffed with salad leaves, with a dollop of yoghurt and chilli sauce alongside."

    "tips": [
        "These burgers are delicious cold, so they make brilliant packed lunches. Mini versions of the burgers also work well as canap\u00e9s, topped with a dab of chilli jam and garnished with sprigs of fresh coriander."
