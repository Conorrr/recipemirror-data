        "For the sponge cake": [
            "250g/9oz butter, at room temperature, plus extra for greasing",
            "250g/9oz caster sugar",
            "pinch salt",
            "5 free-range eggs",
            "1 tsp vanilla extract or \u00bd tsp vanilla bean paste",
            "250g/9oz self-raising flour, plus extra for dusting"
        ],
        "For the filling": [
            "700g/1lb 9oz raspberries",
            "500g/1lb 2oz jam sugar",
            "\u00bd lemon, juice only",

    "steps": [
        "Preheat the oven to 190C/170C Fan/Gas 5. Lightly grease and flour two 20cm/8in loose-bottomed sponge tins, at least 4cm/1\u00bdin deep. Line the bases with baking parchment.",
        "Beat together the butter, caster sugar and a pinch of salt until pale and creamy. Gently whisk the eggs in a small bowl and then add them, a little at a time, to the creamed butter mixture. Add the vanilla and fold in the flour. Divide the mixture between the two prepared tins.",
        "Bake for 25-30 minutes until well-risen and golden-brown on top. Remove from the oven and turn the cakes out onto a wire cooling rack. Peel off the baking parchment and leave to cool completely.",
        "Meanwhile, make the jam. Tip 500g/1lb 2oz of the raspberries, the sugar and lemon juice into a large heavy-bottomed pan and stir over a moderate heat for 2-3 minutes, or until the sugar has dissolved. Turn up the heat and boil for 5 minutes \u2013 this is an \u2018instant jam\u2019 so you don\u2019t have to check for setting point. Remove from the heat, pour into a tray and set aside to cool.",
        "Whip the double cream and put in a piping bag. Place one of the sponges on a plate or cake stand and spread with the jam. Pipe the cream on top of the jam and put the remaining raspberries on top. Place the second sponge on top and dust with icing sugar."
