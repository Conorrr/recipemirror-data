        "Melt the chocolate and butter in a bowl over a pan of simmering water.",
        "In a separate bowl, whisk the yolks with 2 tbsp of the sugar. Stir in the melted chocolate and butter and mix well. Beat the egg whites with the remaining sugar until very stiff, quickly fold into the chocolate mix in two batches and pour the mix in the cake tin.",
