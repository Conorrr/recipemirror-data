        "Preheat your oven to 200C/400F/Gas 6 and line a Swiss roll tin, 22x32cm/8\u00bdx13in or similar, with baking parchment. Oil this very lightly with sunflower oil.",
        "Put the ice cream in a large bowl and beat it with a rolling pin or something similar until soft enough to mould. Put it on a piece of baking parchment and shape it into a thin sausage 25\u201330cm/10-12in long and about 5cm/2in in diameter. Wrap in the parchment and put in the freezer until solid.",
        "To make the Swiss roll, use an electric whisk or a mixer with a whisk attachment to whisk the eggs and sugar together for several minutes until pale, moussey and almost tripled in volume. The mixture should \u2018hold a trail\u2019 when the whisk is removed. Sift the flour over the egg mixture and fold it in lightly. Fold in one tablespoon of warm water.",
        "Pour the mixture into the prepared tin and smooth it out so that it reaches the corners. Bake for 10-12 minutes, or until golden-brown and just firm to the touch.",
        "Cut a sheet of parchment slightly larger than the Swiss roll tin and lay it on your work surface. Sprinkle the parchment with sugar. Tip the cooked sponge onto the parchment, base upwards. Carefully peel the parchment from the base of the sponge. Leave to cool completely.",
        "To assemble the roll, first trim the two long sides of the sponge into neat, straight lines. Spread the jam over the sponge, leaving a 2cm/\u00bein gap at each short edge and a 4cm/1\u00bdin gap along one of the long edges.",
        "Unwrap the ice cream and place it lengthways across the sponge, close to the jammy edge. Use the parchment to help you roll the sponge around the ice cream. Use a bread knife to neatly trim each end of the roll. Place on a plate and serve straight away, in thick slices. You can wrap any uneaten roll and return it to the freezer. Take it out and let it stand for a few minutes so the sponge can soften slightly, before slicing again."
