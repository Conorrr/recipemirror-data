        "For the squash pur\u00e9e, heat the oil and butter in a large pan and gently fry the onion for a few minutes until softened. Add the butternut squash and roast in the pan for five minutes. Pour in the chicken stock and simmer gently for a further 10-12 minutes until tender. Pour in the double cream and season well to taste.",
        "In a food processor, blend the squash until smooth and then pass through a sieve into a clean pan (ready to warm gently just before serving).",
        "For the scallops, season them with salt and pepper. Heat the olive oil in a non-stick frying pan and, once hot, fry the scallops for 1\u20131\u00bd minutes on each side, until caramelized. Towards the end of cooking add a knob of butter and baste the scallops until golden-brown.",
        "To serve, spoon the butternut squash pur\u00e9e into the centre of each plate. Top with the pan-fried scallops and arrange the Ib\u00e9rico ham slices among them. Scatter over the chopped almonds to finish."
