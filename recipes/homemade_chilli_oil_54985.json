        "You can use more or less chillies, depending on the heat you require. To sterilise bottles, wash the bottles in very hot water or put them through the hot cycle of a dishwasher. Place the bottles onto a baking tray and slide into an oven set to 160C/325F/Gas 3 for 10-15 minutes. Keep them warm until filled with the oil."
