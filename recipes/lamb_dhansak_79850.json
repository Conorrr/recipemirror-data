    "description": "Dhansak is a popular Indian curry made from meat, lentils and flavoured with spices including cumin and ginger. It\u2019s mild, sweet and rich with just enough heat to satisfy most tastes. Best of all it benefits from being made a day in advance as it tastes even better re-heated the next day.",

    "tips": [
        "To freeze, transfer to a freezer container and freeze for one month. Don\u2019t freeze for longer as the flavours will intensify. It is difficult to tell how hot a chilli is going to be - the large chillies in supermarkets are usually mild and will give enough heat for most tastes in this curry, but use more or less as desired. Don\u2019t waste any leftover chillies, they freeze well and can be chopped even when frozen. If you don\u2019t have a pestle and mortar for the cardamom seeds, add 1\u00bd tsp ground cardamom instead."
