        "Add the stock, red wine, bay leaves and olives and thyme.",
        "Cover and cook in the oven at 180/350/Gas 4 for two hours. The lamb should be almost falling off the bone.",

        "Simmer until the liquid has gone and the lentils are tender. Add a splash more oil and the lemon juice.",
        "Take the lamb out, reduce the stock for a moment and flake off some big chunks of lamb.",
        "Place a pile of lentils in a rustic dish and pile the lamb on top. Spoon the sauce around and over and serve."
