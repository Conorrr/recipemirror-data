    "description": "Paul Merrett makes a traditional cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e. Copy the picture and serve in small ramekins, or make in a large ovenproof dish. Equipment and preparation: You'll need a shallow ovenproof dish (to make one large cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e) or four br\u00fbl\u00e9e dishes or large ramekins (for individual brulees). You'll also need a mini-blowtorch to caramelise the top.",

    "ingredients": {
        "default": [
            "450ml/16fl oz double cream",
            "50ml/2 fl oz whole milk",
            "2 vanilla pods, split, seeds scraped out (or a few drops vanilla extract)",
            "5 free-range eggs",
            "75g/2\u00bd oz caster sugar, plus 40g/1\u00bd oz more, for the topping"
        ]
    },
    "steps": [
        "Preheat the oven to 150C/300F/Gas 2. Pour the cream and the milk into a heavy-bottomed pan over a medium heat and bring to a simmer.",
        "Split the vanilla pods down the middle with a sharp knife. Scrape out the seeds with the knife and add the seeds and the pods (or the vanilla extract) to the cream and milk mixture. Stir well to combine.",
        "Separate the egg yolks and egg whites. Only the yolks are used in this recipe, so you can use the egg whites for another dish or freeze them for future use.",
        "Pour the caster sugar into the bowl with the yolks. Whisk together the egg yolks and the caster sugar until well combined.",
        "When the cream and milk mixture is coming up to a simmer, pour it (including the vanilla pods, if using) into the bowl with the egg yolk mixture. Stir thoroughly for a minute or two to dissolve the sugar. At this stage, you can chill the mixture in the fridge and make the brulees the following day, or carry on with the recipe.",
        "Ladle the br\u00fbl\u00e9e mixture into the serving dish (or dishes). Discard the vanilla pods.",
        "Place the cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e dishes into a deep baking tray and pour hot water into the tray, until the water reaches halfway up the sides of the dishes (this is called a bain-marie).",
        "Place the bain-marie into the preheated oven and cook the creme brulees for about 30-35 minutes, until set firm but still with a slight wobble. Allow to cool. You can place the br\u00fbl\u00e9es in the fridge at this stage if you're not serving them immediately.",
        "For the topping, sprinkle half of the remaining caster sugar on top of the br\u00fbl\u00e9es. Heat the surface with a mini-blowtorch until it forms a thin layer of caramel.",
        "Sprinkle over the rest of the sugar in a final layer and caramelise with the mini-blowtorch once again, to form a thick crunchy layer. The cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9es are ready to serve immediately or in 2-3 hours."
