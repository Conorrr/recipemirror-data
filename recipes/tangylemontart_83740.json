        "Preheat the oven to 190C/375F/Gas 5.",
        "Roll out the pastry and use to line a large quiche dish (25cm/10in diameter). Line with tin foil and fill with dried beans or rice to hold the base in place.",
        "Bake in the oven for 20 minutes. Remove the foil and baking beans and bake for a further 5 minutes.",
        "Reduce the oven temperature to 150C/300F/Gas 2.",
        "In a mixing bowl, lightly beat the eggs and the sugar (do not whisk). Add the lemon juice and rind and stir. Finally add the cream and stir thoroughly but again, do not whisk.",
        "Transfer the cream mixture into the pastry case and cook in the centre of the oven for about 35 minutes until set (the mixture should set gently like a blancmange and be firm to the touch).",
        "Allow to cool completely, dust with icing sugar and serve with pouring cream and raspberries."
