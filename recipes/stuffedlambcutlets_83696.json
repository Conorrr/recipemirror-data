        "Cut open the centre of the meat of each cutlet until almost through and open out.",
        "Season with salt and freshly ground black pepper, then place a sliver of Fontina or Gruyere cheese on one side of the meat followed by a sage leaf and a little Parma ham.",
        "Fold over the other side of the meat. Dip the cutlets in egg and breadcrumbs to completely coat the meat.",
        "Press the cutlets together to seal and slightly flatten the meat. Shallow fry in moderately hot oil until golden on both sides, for about eight minutes on each side, or until cooked through.",
        "Meanwhile, toss the salad ingredients together. Drizzle in the olive oil and vinegar, and season with salt and freshly ground black pepper.",
        "Serve with the lamb cutlets."
