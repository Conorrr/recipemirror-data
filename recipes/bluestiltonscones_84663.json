        "Add the chopped chives, Stilton, one of the eggs and the parsley and blend again to combine.",
        "With the blender still running, gradually add the milkto form a thick dough.",
        "Place the dough onto a floured surface and roll it out to 2.5cm/1in thick, then cut out six circles with a 5cm/2in fluted pastry cutter.",
        "Break the second egg into a bowl and beat. Brush the top of all the scones with the beaten egg.",
        "Place the scones on the prepared baking sheet and transfer to the oven to bake for 8-10 minutes, or until risen and just turning golden-brown. Remove from the oven and leave on the baking sheet for two minutes to rest.",
