        "Place the couscous, salt and pine nuts in a lidded saucepan and stir well.",
        "Pour the water over (it should be about 2cm/\u00bein above the couscous).",
        "Put the pan lid on and leave until ready to serve.",
        "Gently fork the couscous to break up the grains, before transferring to a bowl to serve.",
        "This makes a great salad meal if you let the couscous go cold and keep in the fridge. If you are serving the couscous with a spicy main, leave this dish the way it is and serve hot. If you're serving it with a plainer meat, such as lamb chops, you could soften some onion in olive oil, and add fresh ginger, chilli and garlic before adding the couscous to the pan."
