        "default": [
            "50g/2oz soft, dark-brown sugar",
            "50g/2oz golden syrup",
            "50g/2oz butter",
            "50g/2oz plain flour, plus extra for dusting",
            "1 tsp ground ginger",
            "300ml/10fl oz double cream, whipped to firm peaks"
        ]

    "steps": [
        "Preheat the oven to 180C/350F/Gas 4 and line a baking tray with baking parchment.",
        "Melt the sugar, golden syrup and butter in a saucepan. When the sugar granules have dissolved, remove the pan from the heat.",
        "Add the flour and ground ginger and mix well to form a thick paste.",
        "Place a piece of cling film on a work surface and turn out the paste. Roll the mixture into a ball, then cover in the cling film and chill in the fridge until set (about 30 minutes).",
        "Remove the chilled brandy snap dough from the fridge and roll it into walnut-sized balls using your hands - you should get at least four from this mixture.",
        "Dust a work surface with flour. Roll each ball of dough out into a disc approximately 2mm/1/16in thick, then place on the baking tray.",
        "Bake the brandy snaps in the oven for 6-8 minutes, or until crisp and golden-brown. Remove from the oven and set aside to cool for approximately one minute.",
        "Carefully lift each brandy snap off the tray and roll around the end of a wooden spoon \u2013 leaving on it to cool for a minute before removing. If possible, it is best to mould the brandy snaps around several spoons at the same time while they are all still hot.",
        "To serve, spoon the cream into a piping bag fitted with a star-shaped nozzle. Pipe the cream into the brandy snaps and pile onto a plate. Serve immediately."
