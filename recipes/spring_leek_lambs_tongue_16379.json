    "steps": [
        "For the sweetbread fritters, begin by heating a non-stick frying pan. Once hot, add the olive oil and the diced sweetbreads, season with salt and freshly ground black pepper and cook until crisp.",
        "Add the shallots, garlic and parsley to the pan and fry for a minute.",
        "Pour in the lamb gravy and take off the heat.",
        "Pour the sweetbreads mixture into ice cube containers and freeze.",
        "For the lamb\u2019s tongue, bring a large pan of water to the boil, add all the ingredients then return to a simmer and cook for 2\u00bd - 3 hours.",
        "Once cooked, remove from the heat and let the lamb\u2019s tongues cool in the stock. Once cooled, remove the tongues from the stock, peel them and cut into strips.",
        "Mix the eggs and milk to make an egg wash. Place the flour, egg wash and breadcrumbs into three separate bowls.",
        "Once the sweetbread fritters are frozen, turn them out of the moulds and cover them first with the flour, then egg wash, then breadcrumbs. Repeat this process three times on each fritter.",
        "Set the fritters aside to defrost.",
        "For the leeks, preheat the oven to 180C/350F/Gas 4.",
        "Place the cleaned leeks onto aluminium foil. Add the thyme, bay leaves, garlic and a knob of butter. Season well with salt and freshly ground black pepper and drizzle with olive oil.",
        "Wrap up the aluminium foil, to make a parcel, and cook in the oven for 30-35 minutes, or until the leeks are tender.",
        "For the gribiche, mix all the ingredients together and set aside.",
        "To finish the lamb\u2019s tongues, heat a frying pan until hot, add a splash of oil and the lamb\u2019s tongue strips and fry until crisp and golden-brown.",
        "To finish the sweetbread fritters, heat a deep fat fryer to 190C/375F. Or alternatively heat vegetable oil in a deep sided, heavy-based pan until a breadcrumb sizzles and turns golden-brown when dropped into it. (CAUTION: hot oil can be dangerous. Do not leave unattended.)",
        "Carefully drop the sweetbread fritters into the oil and cook for 2-3 minutes until golden-brown, crisp, and hot through.",
        "Remove the fritters from the hot oil with a slotted spoon, and drain onto kitchen paper. Season with a little salt and freshly ground black pepper.",
        "To serve, cut the leek down the centre and place one half on each serving plate. Spoon some gribiche on top of the leek. Place the fritter and lamb\u2019s tongue on top of the gribiche. Garnish with sliced baby carrots, broad beans, parsley leaf, radishes and shallot rings."
