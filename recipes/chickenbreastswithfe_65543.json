            "4 boneless chicken breasts",

            "2 tbsp olive oil",
            "30g/1oz butter",
            "2 tbsp fresh fennel seeds",
            "salt and freshly ground black pepper"

        "For the marinade": [
            "2 tbsp clear honey",
            "2 lemons, juice only",
            "4 tbsp olive oil",
            "pinch salt",

    "steps": [
        "Mix all the marinade ingredients in a wide, shallow bowl, adding a little salt. Add the chicken breasts and turn them to coat thoroughly. Cover with cling film and leave for 1 hour, turning them halfway.",
        "Cut the fennel lengthways into 5mm/\u00bcin thick slices. Blanch in salted boiling water for 5 minutes, refresh and drain.",
        "Cut the carrots into 5mm/\u00bcin diagonal slices. Do not cook the vegetables together. Score the surface, then blanch for 3 minutes, refresh and drain. Lightly brush the fennel and carrots with olive oil.",
        "Heat a griddle pan until smoking hot. Add the fennel first, then the carrots and griddle for 5-10 minutes, giving them a quarter-turn to mark attractively. Turn them over and repeat on the other side. Season, place on a plate and keep hot.",
        "Put the chicken breasts in the hot griddle pan, skin side down. Once they are marked with lines, quarter-turn to make a lattice pattern. Turn them over, lower the heat and give them a quarter-turn as before. Cook for 12-15 minutes in total, depending on thickness.",
        "Arrange the fennel slices on plates and top with the chicken. Place the carrots alongside. Put a knob of butter on each chicken breast and top with fennel seeds."
