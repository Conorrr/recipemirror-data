        "Preheat the oven to 200C/400F/Gas 6.",
        "Slice the doughballs in half and then cut a thin slice off of the rounded side so that both halves have a flat base to stand on. Butter the upper side and arrange on a baking tray lined with baking paper.",
        "Mix the goats\u2019 cheese, pesto and thyme together in a small bowl. Spread this onto the buttered side of the doughballs, making sure that it is spread up to the edges.",
        "Slice the tomatoes into thick slices and put one slice on top of each doughball half. Season with salt and freshly ground black pepper and then sprinkle over the parmesan cheese.",
        "Bake for 10 minutes, or until crisp and lightly golden-brown. Serve warm."
