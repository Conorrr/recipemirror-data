        "Preheat the oven to 200C/400F/Gas 6.",

        "Allow the vegetables to cool slightly, then place half into a food processor and add 500ml/17fl oz of the vegetable stock. Blend to a pur\u00e9e and transfer to a large pan. Repeat with the remaining roasted vegetables and 500ml/17fl oz more of the stock - transfer the pur\u00e9e to the pan.",
        "Add the remaining 500ml/17fl oz of vegetable stock to the food processor and stir to catch any remnants of the vegetable pur\u00e9e, then pour into the pan.",
        "Add the marsala wine and season, to taste, with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Add a little more water if the soup is too thick for your liking.",
        "For the buttermilk cheese sauce, place the blue cheese and buttermilk into a clean food processor and blend to a paste. Transfer the blue cheese sauce to a jug or bowl.",
        "To serve, ladle the soup into bowls and drizzle some of the blue cheese into each bowl. Leave the sauce on the table for your guests to add more if they wish."
