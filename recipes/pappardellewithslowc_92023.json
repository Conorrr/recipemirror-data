        "Add the cooked, drained pasta, softened butter and half of the grated parmesan to the slow-cooked beef and mushrooms, stirring well until the pasta is coated in the sauce and the butter has melted.",
        "Divide the pappardelle with slow-cooked beef and mushrooms equally among four serving bowls. Spoon over the tomato salsa and sprinkle over the remaining parmesan."
