            "1 kohlrabi, finely grated",
            "small knob galangal root, finely grated (you can use fresh root ginger if galangal is not available)",
            "2 sprigs fresh mint",
            "handful Thai basil, finely chopped",
            "1-2 chillies, finely chopped",
            "2 tbsp rice flour",
            "vegetable oil, for deep-frying",
            "handful coriander, finely chopped"

    "steps": [
        "In a food processor, blend together the prawns, spring onions, carrots, kohlrabi, galangal, mint, basil and chilli to a coarse texture, rather than a completely smooth paste. Use a tablespoon to scoop walnut-sized balls out of the mixture and coat each ball in the rice flour.",
        "Heat the vegetable oil in a deep heavy-bottomed pan or wok, until a breadcrumb sizzles and browns when dropped in it. (CAUTION: hot oil can be dangerous - do not leave unattended.)",
        "Add each fritter to the pan, one-by-one, until the mixture is used up (you may have to cook the fritters in batches if necessary).",
        "When the fritters are golden-brown, remove from the pan with a slotted spoon and transfer to a dish lined with kitchen paper.",
        "Serve straightaway."
