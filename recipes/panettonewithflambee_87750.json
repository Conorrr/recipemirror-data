        "Preheat the oven to 220C/425F/Gas 7.",
        "Slice off the top of the panettone and pick out the soft inside leaving a 5mm/\u00bcinch thick edge (reserve the crumbs to use in another dish, or eat as they are!).",

        "Spoon the fig mixture into the hollowed out panettone and serve at once."
