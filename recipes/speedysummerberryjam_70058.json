    "steps": [
        "Wash and remove any stalks from the fruits. Place in a pan with water and bring to the boil. Leave to simmer for 10-15 minutes, stirring frequently. Add the sugar, stir until it has dissolved and boil for a further 15-20 minutes.",
        "Transfer to any airtight jars (a couple of clip jars are perfect) to cool. Once cooled, cover and chill in the fridge where it will thicken and become more jam-like. It will keep for up to 2 months.",
        "Spread the jam over hot, buttered toasted teacakes, crumpets or scones - or how about another British classic, the jam sandwich.",
        "The jam adds a fruity tang stirred into natural yogurt, or you can gently heat it and serve with ice cream or on pancakes with thick cream."
