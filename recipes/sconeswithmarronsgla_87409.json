        "Preheat the oven to 220C/425F/Gas 7.",
        "For the scones, place the flour, baking powder and salt into a food processor with the butter and caster sugar. Blend until the mixture resembles breadcrumbs. Add the milk and blend until the mixture forms a dough.",
        "Turn out the dough onto a floured surface and knead until the mixture is smooth. Roll or pat into a block 2.5cm/1in thick. Using a floured round cutter, cut into five scones.",
        "Press a chestnut into the top of each scone and brush with a little milk.",
        "Place the scones onto a non-stick baking sheet and bake for 15 minutes, or until well-risen and golden-brown.",
        "For the sauce, melt the chocolate with the double cream in a mixing bowl set over a pan of just-simmering water (make sure that the bowl does not touch the surface of the water). Stir until melted and well-combined.",
        "To serve, dust the scones with icing sugar and drizzle over the hot chocolate sauce."
