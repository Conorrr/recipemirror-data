    "description": "Tav\u00eb kosi is a national dish in Albania, but I only had it once, at a restaurant at the top of a mountain pass at Llogara. I wasn\u2019t predisposed to like it. Lamb with rice and yoghurt doesn\u2019t immediately appeal, but it turned out to be very good indeed, the same sort of dish as moussaka.",
