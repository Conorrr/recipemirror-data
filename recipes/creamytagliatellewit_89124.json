        "Cook the pasta and broccoli in boiling salted water until tender, then drain and stir into the cheesy cream sauce.",
        "Place the hollowed-out loaf on a baking tray and place into the oven for 2-3 minutes, or until crisp and lightly golden. Rub the inside of the loaf 'shell' with the garlic, then place the loaf on a serving late. Fill with the pasta, broccoli and cheesy cream mixture and serve."
