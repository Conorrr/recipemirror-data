        "Place the grains in a pan and just cover them with water. Leave for an hour or two to soak.",

        "While the porridge is cooking, heat the broth in a saucepan and place the moss and leaves in a small teapot, preferably made from glass. When the broth is hot pour it over the moss and leave to macerate for a while.",
        "Place some of the porridge in a small, heated bowl and tap the bottom so that the surface of the porridge becomes flat. Add one teaspoon of chive oil and sprinkle, chopped carrots, dried chives and puffed grains over the surface until covered.",
        "To serve pour broth into the bowl, the broth should completely cover the porridge so that all the garnishes float around in it."
