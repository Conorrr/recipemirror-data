    "steps": [
        "Make a sugar syrup by heating the caster sugar with 100ml/3\u00bdfl oz water until the sugar has completely dissolved. Set aside to cool slightly.",
        "Put the cherries in a large pan with 50ml/2fl oz of the sugar syrup and half the cherry brandy. Cook for 5-10 minutes, then set aside to cool.",
        "Whisk together half the cream and all the custard.",
        "Soak the cake slices in the remaining brandy and 50ml/2fl oz sugar syrup.",
        "In a large serving bowl, create the layers. First add the cherries, then the soaked cake and top with the cream and custard mixture.",
        "Put the remaining whipped cream in a piping bag and pipe swirls onto the top of the trifle. Cover with the grated chocolate.",
        "To decorate, melt the sugar into a non-stick pan set over a medium heat. Keep heating until a dark-brown caramel forms (CAUTION: Do not leave unattended), then immediately dunk the pan in cold water to prevent the caramel burning.",
        "Carefully dip the cherries into the caramel and place on a silicone mat or non-stick baking parchment to cool completely. When cool decorate the trifle with them."
    ],
    "tips": [
        "If you don't have a piping bag you can use a clean plastic food bag instead. Simply spoon the cream into a corner, twist the open end to seal and snip off the tip."
