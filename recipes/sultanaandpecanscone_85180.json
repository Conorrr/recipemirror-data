        "Preheat the oven to 220C/425F/Gas 7.",
        "For the scones, place the flour, sugar, 50g/1\u00beoz butter and the salt into a food processor and blend until the mixture resembles breadcrumbs.",
        "Add the milk gradually until the mixture comes together as a dough (you may not need it all). Stir in the sultanas.",
        "Turn the dough out onto a floured surface and lightly roll out to 2.5cm/1in thick. Cut out 5cm/2in circles with a fluted pastry cutter.",
        "Heat a griddle pan over a medium heat, add the remaining butter and griddle the scones for 2-3 minutes on each side. Transfer to a baking sheet and place in the oven for 5-6 minutes, or until golden-brown and cooked through.",
        "For the caramelised pecans, gently melt the sugar in a frying pan until golden. Stir in the pecans and orange juice and stir to coat the nuts. Pour onto a non-stick baking sheet and leave to cool.",
        "To serve, place the scones onto plates and sprinkle over the caramelised pecans."
