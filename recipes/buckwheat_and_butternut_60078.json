        "Divide the batter equally among the cupcake cases (about 3 tablespoons per paper case). Bake for 18-20 minutes, or until a skewer inserted into the centre of the cupcakes comes out clean. Remove the cupcakes from the tin and set aside to cool on a wire rack until completely cold.",

        "Transfer the tahini maple icing to a piping bag and ice the cupcakes. Sprinkle with the rose petals or grated vegan chocolate and serve."
