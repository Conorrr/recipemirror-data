    "steps": [
        "Preheat the oven to 190C/380F/Gas 5.",
        "To make the b\u00e9chamel, melt the butter in a small heavy-based pan over a medium heat.",
        "Remove from the heat and stir in the flour (this is called a roux). Return the pan to a low heat and cook for two minutes, whisking continuously.",
        "Remove from the heat again and add the milk, stirring constantly.",
        "Place over a medium heat and bring to the boil, stirring continuously. Reduce the heat and simmer for 4-5 minutes, stirring continuously. Allow to cool slightly.",
        "For the souffl\u00e9, beat the egg yolks into the b\u00e9chamel and season well with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Cover with cling film and set aside at room temperature.",
        "Meanwhile, grease the insides of four individual souffl\u00e9 dishes or ramekins (10cm/4in in diameter and 6.5cm/2\u00bdin deep) with softened butter.",
        "Sprinkle a handful of the grated gruy\u00e8re into each souffl\u00e9 dish, rotating it to coat the insides.",
        "Place the smoked haddock into a small pan. Add the cream and place over a low heat. When the cream starts to just come to the boil, reduce the heat to a gentle simmer and cook for two minutes.",
        "Turn off the heat and leave to rest until cool enough to handle, then remove the skin from the haddock and flake the fish into a bowl with your fingertips, removing any bones you may find. Return the fish to the heated cream.",
        "In a clean bowl, whisk the egg whites with a pinch of salt, until soft peaks form when the whisk is removed.",
        "Place one third of the egg whites into the b\u00e9chamel mixture and stir well.",
        "Add the b\u00e9chamel and egg white mixture to the bowl of remaining egg whites and fold in very gently, adding the gruy\u00e8re and dill as you fold.",
        "Half-fill each prepared souffl\u00e9 dish or ramekin with the souffl\u00e9 mixture, then spoon in equal amounts of the smoked haddock and cream mixture.",
        "Fill the dishes with the remaining souffl\u00e9 so that the mixture is slightly above the top edge.",
        "Smooth the surface with a palette knife and run a knife around the inside edge of the dish to ease the souffl\u00e9 mixture away from the side of the dish - this helps the souffl\u00e9 to rise.",
        "Stand the souffl\u00e9 dishes into a deep roasting pan and pour in enough boiling water to come halfway up the sides of the dishes (this is a bain-marie).",
        "Place into the oven to cook for 7-8 minutes, or until risen and golden.",
        "To serve, top each souffl\u00e9 with a poached quail's egg and a sprig of dill. Serve immediately."
