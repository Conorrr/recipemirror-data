        "Preheat the oven to 180C/350F/Gas 4.",
        "For the potato wedges, place the wedges in a bowl and add the olive oil, chilli powder, curry powder, thyme, salt and freshly ground black pepper. Toss well to coat, then transfer to a roasting tin.",
        "For the tomato, drizzle the tomato with the olive oil and add to the tin with the potatoes, followed by the garlic. Roast in the oven for 13-15 minutes, or until the potatoes are golden-brown and tender and the tomatoes are softened.",
        "For the steak, season the meat with salt and freshly ground black pepper and rub the oil in. Heat a pan until smoking and cook the steak for 2-3 minutes on both sides (for rare), or until cooked to your liking. Add the butter towards the end of cooking. Remove the steak from the pan and allow to rest on a warm plate for ten minutes.",
        "For the red wine sauce, pour the wine into the steak pan to deglaze, then bring to the boil and cook for 5-6 minutes, or until the liquid has reduced by half.",
        "Serve the steak sliced and fanned out with the wedges and tomato stacked up beside it, and the sauce spooned around the edge."
