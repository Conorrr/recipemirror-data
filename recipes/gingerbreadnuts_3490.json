        "Put the treacle into a basin, and pour over it the melted butter, the sugar and ginger. Stir these ingredients well together, and whilst mixing, add the candied peel, which should be cut into very small pieces, but not bruised, and the caraway and coriander seeds, which should be pounded.",
        "Having mixed it all thoroughly together, break in an egg, and work the whole mixture together with as much flour as is necessary to form a paste. Roll this out and stamp into nuts of any size and put them on a tin plate, and bake in a slow oven from \u00bc to \u00bd hour."
