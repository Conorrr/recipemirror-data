        "Sift the flour and icing sugar into a large bowl and add the soya margarine.",
        "Use your fingertips to rub the fat into the flour until you have a mixture that resembles coarse breadcrumbs with no large lumps of margarine remaining. Try to work quickly so that it doesn't become greasy.",
        "Bring the mixture together to form a dough, adding extra flour if the mixture is too wet, or some water if too dry, a teaspoon at a time.",
        "Wrap the dough in cling-film and chill for 10-15 minutes before using."
