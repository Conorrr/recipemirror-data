        "Preheat the oven to 180C/355F/Gas 4.",
        "Place the sugar into a non-stick pan over a medium-low heat. Leave to melt (avoid stirring the sugar until it has done so), then when the sugar begins to caramelise and turn golden-brown, add the fruit, vanilla seeds and butter. Stir and cook for a further 1-2 minutes, then remove from the heat.",
        "Lay the puff pastry out onto a clean work surface and cut out 15cm/6in circles with a cutter (the pastry will yield around 4-6 circles). Spoon about a tablespoon of the fruit mixture onto one half of each circle, then brush the edges with the beaten egg and fold the other half of the pastry over. Seal the edges, then brush the parcel all over with the beaten egg. Crimp the edges with a fork and sprinkle with sugar. Place the pastry parcels onto a baking tray.",
        "Bake the pastry puffs in the oven for 13-15 minutes, or until golden-brown.",
        "To serve, place the peach and apricot puffs on serving plates and spoon some clotted cream alongside. Drizzle over some caramel sauce and garnish the plate with some raspberries."
