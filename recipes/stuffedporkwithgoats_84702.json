        "Preheat the oven to 200C/400F/Gas 6.",

        "Heat the remaining olive oil in a small frying pan over a medium heat, add the courgette to the pan and fry for 2-3 minutes. Sprinkle over the thyme, season well with salt and freshly ground black pepper and cook for a further 2-3 minutes, or until softened and beginning to turn golden-brown.",
