        "Melt the butter in a pan over a medium heat. Add the shallots and garlic and fry until softened but not coloured.",
        "Add the rice, stir well and cook for 1-2 minutes, or until the rice is slightly translucent.",
        "Add the white wine and stir well until the wine is almost completely absorbed.",
