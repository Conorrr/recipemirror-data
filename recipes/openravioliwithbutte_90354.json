        "For the pasta, place all of the pasta ingredients together into a food processor and pulse until the mixture comes together to form a dough. Tip out onto a floured surface and knead into a ball, then wrap in cling film and allow to rest in the fridge for 5-10 minutes.",
        "Roll out the pasta dough as thin as possible, then cut into 5cm/2in squares with a sharp knife. Boil the pasta squares in boiling salted water, or until al dente, then drain.",
        "For the filling, heat the olive oil in a pan and fry the butternut squash and garlic for 2-3 minutes, then add the courgettes and tomatoes and cook for 4-5 minutes, or until the vegetables are tender. Stir in the sage and cream, and season, to taste, with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Simmer for 6-8 minutes, or until the squash is tender.",
        "For the herb paste, pulse all of the pesto ingredients together in a food processor until smooth, adding more oil if necessary.",
        "Place the pasta squares onto a serving plate and spoon the squash filling into the middle of each square. Spoon the pesto around the edges of the plate and serve."
