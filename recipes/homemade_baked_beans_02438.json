    "steps": [
        "Preheat the oven to 200C/180C Fan/Gas 6.",
        "Heat a tablespoon of the oil in an ovenproof frying pan over a medium heat. Add the sausages and fry for 2-3 minutes, or until browned on all sides. Transfer the pan to the oven and continue to cook for 10-12 minutes, or until cooked through.",
        "Meanwhile, heat another tablespoon of the oil in a separate frying pan over a medium heat. Add the shallots and fry for 2-3 minutes, or until softened. Add the rosemary and garlic and fry for a further 1-2 minutes.",
        "Add the chopped tomatoes and bring the mixture to the boil, then reduce the heat until the mixture is simmering. Add the stock and beans, return the mixture to a simmer and cook for 3-4 minutes, or until the sauce has thickened slightly.",
        "Stir in the parsley and season, to taste, with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Keep warm.",
        "Just before serving, heat a griddle pan over a medium heat. Drizzle a little of the remaining tablespoon of oil onto each side of the bread slices. Grill the bread for 1-2 minutes on each side, or until golden-brown chargrill marks appear on both sides.",
        "To serve, place one slice of toast onto each serving plate. Spoon over the bean mixture and top each with a sausage or two."
