        "For the parsnips, mix together the flour and curry powder in a bowl and use to dust the parsnip wedges.",
        "Half fill a thick-based pan with the vegetable oil and heat until a cube of bread dropped in sizzles and turns golden-brown in 30 seconds. (CAUTION: hot oil can be dangerous. Do not leave unattended.) Deep-fry the parsnip wedges, in batches, in the hot oil for 4-5 minutes, or until golden-brown and crisp. Remove with a slotted spoon and drain on kitchen paper.",
        "For the r\u00f6sti, place the grated potato into a clean tea towel and squeeze out the excess moisture. Heat the oil and butter in a small frying pan and fry the potato for 4-5 minutes, or until golden-brown underneath. Carefully turn the r\u00f6sti and fry for a further 4-5 minutes, or until golden-brown all over.",
        "Serve the potato r\u00f6sti alongside the parsnip chips."
