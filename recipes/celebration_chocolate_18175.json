    "steps": [
        "Heat the oven to 180C/350F/Gas 4 and grease and line with greased greaseproof paper the bases of two 20cm/8in straight-sided loose bottomed sandwich tins.",
        "Sift the dry ingredients into a large bowl and make a well in the centre. Add the syrup, eggs, oil and milk, mix with an electric hand whisk and pour into the tins.",
        "Bake in the oven for 25-30 minutes, or until the cakes springs back when lightly pressed with your fingertips. Turn out on a wire rack, remove the paper and leave to cool.",
        "For the icing, break the white chocolate into a bowl. Heat the double cream in a pan, until very hot but not boiling and pour the hot cream over the white chocolate to melt it. Stir until melted and set aside to cool.",
        "Spoon the cream cheese into a bowl then gradually add the white chocolate mixture and stir until combined. Set aside to cool a little, until thick enough to ice.",
        "Spread half of the icing on one cake, sit the other cake on top and spread the remaining icing on top to give a pretty finish."

    "tips": [
        "This is a great recipe to make for and with children. Mary always places a large plate underneath the mixing bowl so that there\u2019s no worry that when the child cracks an egg on the side of the bowl most of it doesn\u2019t go on the table."
