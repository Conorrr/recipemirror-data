        "Remove the skin from the haddock and place the fish in a saucepan with the fish stock and bay leaf. Bring to a simmer.",
        "Meanwhile, heat a high-sided frying pan until hot and add 50g/1\u00beoz of the butter and a tablespoon of olive oil.",
        "Add the shallots and garlic and gently fry for two minutes, or until just softened. Add the rice and cook for a minute. Add the vermouth and cook until evaporated.",
        "Add the hot fish stock (used to poach the haddock) a ladleful at a time, stirring constantly, until all but 200ml/7fl oz of the fish stock is absorbed and the rice tender. Remove from the heat.",
        "Add 60g/2\u00bdoz of the parmesan, 25g/1oz of butter, salt and black pepper and stir to combine.",
        "Heat a separate frying pan until hot and add 50g/1\u00beoz of the butter. When melted add the leeks. Gently fry for 1-2 minutes, or until just tender then fold them into the cooked risotto.",
        "Add half the remaining butter to the frying pan the leeks were cooked in, along with a tablespoon of olive oil.",
        "Add the smoked haddock and fry for 1-2 minutes on each side until golden-brown and hot through.",
        "Strain the remaining fish stock into a small saucepan and add the whipping cream and grainy mustard. Bring to a simmer.",
        "Bring a small pan of water to the boil and add the vinegar. Poach the eggs for around 3\u00bd minutes, or until soft poached.",
        "To serve, place a spoonful of risotto into each serving bowl. Top with the haddock then place a poached egg on top of the haddock. Using a hand blender, froth the stock and mustard mixture and spoon around the haddock.",
        "Drizzle over the remaining olive oil and sprinkle with parmesan."
