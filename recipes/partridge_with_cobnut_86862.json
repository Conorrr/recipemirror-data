    "steps": [
        "Preheat the oven to 150C/300F/Gas 2.",
        "Heat the oil in a pan and fry the partridge legs to colour them all over.",
        "Place the partridge legs in an ovenproof dish.",
        "Add the mixed game and pour over the goose fat. Set aside the partridge breasts.",
        "Place in the oven for two hours to gently confit.",
        "Once cooked, carefully remove the partridge from the fat with a slotted spoon. Season the confit and press it together to form a slim sausage shape and wrap tightly in cling film. Place in the fridge to set.",
        "Set the oven to 180C/350F/Gas 4.",
        "Mix the oats, flour, parmesan, cayenne pepper, salt and pepper in a bowl.",
        "Add just enough boiling water to make a dough that is not sticky.",
        "On a lightly floured surface, roll out the dough and cut into rounds.",
        "Grease a baking tray with olive oil and place the rounds on the prepared baking tray. Cook for 12-15 minutes",
        "Gently fry the cobnuts in a frying pan. Chop them finely and set aside for the crust.",
        "Season the partridge breasts, brown lightly in a pan before placing in the oven for 6-8 minutes, or until the partridge is cooked but still slightly pink in the middle. Brush with some of the melted butter and dip into the cobnuts to form a crust.",
        "To assemble the dish, slice a small round of the confit game, brush with a little melted butter and dip in chopped chives. Put the game, breast and oatcakes onto each plate and garnish with blackberries and fresh herbs."
