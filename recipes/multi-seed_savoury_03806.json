            "230g/8oz wholemeal flour",
            "115g/4oz semolina",
            "\u00be tsp fine salt (smoked or fleur de sel Gu\u00e9rande if available)",
            "55g/2oz sesame seeds",
            "55g/2oz flax seed",
            "55g/2oz pumpkin seeds \u2013 roughly ground",
            "1 tbsp runny honey",
            "3\u00bd tbsp vegetable oil, plus extra for greasing",

    "steps": [
        "In a large bowl, mix the wholemeal flour, semolina and salt together with the sesame, flax and ground pumpkin seeds.",
        "In separate bowl, whisk 210ml/7\u00bcfl oz water with the honey and oil. Stir in to the dry ingredients and mix to a medium-firm dough.",
        "Knead the dough for five minutes. Return to the bowl, cover and set aside for 20 minutes.",
        "Preheat oven to 180C/375F/Gas 4. Line 2-3 baking trays with non-stick parchment.",
        "Oil the work surface and roll the dough out to a thickness of 3mm.",
        "Using a ruler and a sharp knife or pizza cutter, cut the dough into rectangles or diamonds, of approximately 5x15cm/2x6in. Place on to the prepared trays close together, but not touching.",
        "Spray the crackers with water. At this point you can add a topping if you wish (more ground seeds or spices). You can reknead any left-over scraps, but they will not be as successful as first kneading. Alternatively, put the scraps on a tray and bake them for snacking.",
        "Bake the crackers for 15-18 minutes. Turn the oven off, open the door for 30 seconds and close again. Leave the trays in the residual heat of the oven for 10-15 minutes for extra crispness. Transfer to a wire rack to cool."
