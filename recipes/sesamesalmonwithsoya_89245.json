        "Roll the salmon slices in the sesame seeds to coat, patting gently so the seeds stick to the fish, then shake off any excess. Heat the sesame oil in a frying pan over a medium heat, then add the salmon and fry for 3-4 minutes on each side, or until golden-brown and crisp. Remove from the pan and set aside.",
        "Add the soy sauce and orange and lime juice to the pan and cook for 2-3 minutes, or until the liquid has reduced slightly. Stir in the chopped coriander.",
        "To serve, pile the shredded spinach leaves onto a serving plate and top with the salmon. Spoon over the soy and citrus dressing and garnish with the lime halves, dill and coriander."
