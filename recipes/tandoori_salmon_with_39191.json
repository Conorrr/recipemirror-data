        "For the tandoori salmon, place all the spices in a medium bowl and mix with the oil and yoghurt. Smear half of the paste all over the fish and leave to marinate in the fridge for at least an hour. Reserve the remaining paste to make a sauce.",
        "Meanwhile, place the potatoes in a large pan of salted water and cook for 6-7 minutes, or until just tender. Drain well.",
        "Heat 3 tablespoons of the olive oil over a low heat. Add the smoked paprika, chilli, cumin and garlic. Cook for 1-2 minutes. Add the chopped tomatoes and cook for 2-3 minutes.",
        "Heat another frying pan and add the remaining oil, once hot add the potatoes and cook until golden-brown. Just before serving add the tomato mixture to the potatoes and heat through.",
        "For the kachumber salad, place the tomato and onion in a large bowl with the salt and sugar. Mix the lemon juice and olive oil in a small bowl and pour over the tomatoes and onion along with the coriander and mint.",
        "Once the salmon has marinated pre-heat the grill to medium heat. Place the salmon on a foil lined tray and grill for 3-4 minutes on each side.",
        "Place the reserved tandoori paste in a small saucepan and gently warm.",
        "To serve, place a spoonful of salad alongside the grilled salmon and potatoes and spoon over the tandoori sauce."
