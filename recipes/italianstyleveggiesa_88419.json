        "For the potato and sausage, heat the oil in a separate frying pan and fry the cubes of potato and the sausage halves until coloured and cooked through, about 7-8 minutes.",
        "To serve, pile the potatoes and sausages onto a serving plate and pour over the tomato sauce. Garnish with chervil."
