    "steps": [
        "Preheat the oven to 220C/425F/Gas 7.",
        "Pierce each chestnut with a knife, making a small slit in the shell - this prevents them from exploding in the oven. Place the chestnuts onto a baking tray and roast in the oven for 20-25 minutes, until tender. Remove from the oven and allow to cool, then peel, and roughly chop.",
        "Heat a frying pan until hot, add the butter and shallots and cook for 1-2 minutes.",
        "Add the mushrooms and fry for a further one minute.",
        "Add the brandy and carefully set light to the brandy with a match or by tilting the pan towards the flame. Be careful not to do this under any low fixtures and be careful of loose clothing.",
        "Add the cream and chestnuts and bring to the boil. Reduce the heat and simmer for two minutes.",
        "Meanwhile, bring a large pan of salted water to the boil, add the pasta and cook according to packet instructions. Drain the pasta, then add to the sauce.",
        "Add the parsley, chervil and parmesan and season, to taste, with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Mix well and serve in bowls."
