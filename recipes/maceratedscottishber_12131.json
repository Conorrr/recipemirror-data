        "Dissolve the caster sugar and water together, bring to the boil until slightly reduced and cool. Add the orange juice.",

        "To serve, simply ladle out the berries into four chilled bowls. Scoop the sorbet and place into the centre of the bowls. You can serve a biscuit with this dish - for example, cantuccini or brandy snaps. Garnish with a sprig of mint and icing sugar. Serve immediately."
