        "Preheat the oven to 200C/400F/Gas 6.",
        "To make the kiev, heat the oil in a deep, heavy-bottomed saucepan until a breadcrumb sizzles and turns brown in it. (CAUTION: hot oil can be dangerous. Do not leave unattended.)",
        "Using a sharp knife, cut a pocket halfway into the chicken breast. Stuff the cheese into the pocket.",
        "Dredge the chicken in the flour mixture, then dip into the egg, then into the breadcrumbs. Repeat the dipping with the egg and breadcrumbs.",
        "Carefully lower the chicken into the hot oil and deep fry for 2-3 minutes, until golden. Carefully remove with a slotted spoon and drain on kitchen paper.",
        "Place onto a baking sheet and transfer to the oven and bake for five minutes, or until completely cooked through.",
        "For the pickled cabbage, place all of the pickled cabbage ingredients into a bowl and mix together well.",
        "To serve, place the pickled cabbage onto a plate and top with the chicken kiev."
