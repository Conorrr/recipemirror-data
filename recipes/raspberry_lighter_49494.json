        "Whisk the egg yolks and sugar together in a bowl until thick. Sieve over the cocoa powder and whisk in until full incorporated.",
        "In a clean glass bowl using clean beaters, whisk the egg whites until stiff. Fold them into the cocoa mixture a spoonful at a time. Pour the mixture into the baking tin and spread out evenly. Bake for 20 minutes. Use a knife to cut the edges away from the tin, then leave to cool.",
        "Turn the Swiss roll out on to a sheet of baking paper. Whisk the double cream, then fold in the cr\u00e8me fraiche. Using a spatula, spread this over the sponge. Sprinkle over the raspberries. Roll up from one of the short sides.",
        "Melt the dark chocolate in a microwave or in a bowl over a pan of boiling water. Drizzle the chocolate over the top of the cake."
