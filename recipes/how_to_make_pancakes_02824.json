    "steps": [
        "Put the flour into a large bowl, make a well in the centre and pour in the milk and eggs. Give the liquid mixture a quick whisk before incorporating the flour. Continue to whisk until you have a smooth batter.",
        "Now add 1 tbsp vegetable oil and whisk thoroughly.",
        "Take a cr\u00eape pan, or large frying pan, dip some kitchen roll in the oil and carefully wipe the inside of the pan. Heat the pan over a medium heat for a minute.",
        "Add just under a ladleful of batter to the pan and immediately start swirling it round the pan to get a nice even layer.",
        "Cook the pancake for approximately 30-40 seconds. Use a palette knife to lift the pancake carefully to look at the underside to check it is golden-brown before turning over. Cook the other side for approx 30-40 seconds and transfer to a serving plate."

    "tips": [
        "The pancakes can be eaten straight away, or frozen after cooling - stack and wrap them in twos. You can use this batter to make sweet or savoury pancakes. For sweet pancakes you can add a desert spoon of caster sugar and the zest of an orange, this will give the pancakes a great flavour. For savoury pancakes you can add some finely chopped herbs such as dill and parsley, or perhaps some grated Parmesan cheese."
