        "Heat a griddle pan until smoking. Brush the pork chop with oil and add to the griddle to cook for six minutes. Turn the chop over and cook for a further six minutes, or until browned and cooked through. When cooked, the juices will run clear when pierced with a sharp knife. Remove from the heat and set aside to rest for three minutes.",
        "For the pepper sauce, heat the butter in a pan over a medium heat. Once the butter has foamed, add the red pepper and onion and saut\u00e9 for six minutes, until softened.",
        "Transfer the red pepper and onion into a food processor and blend to a smooth pur\u00e9e. Add the tomato ketchup, cream and white wine and blend again briefly to mix.",
        "To serve, place the pork onto a plate and drizzle over the pepper sauce."
