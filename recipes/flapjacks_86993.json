        "Preheat the oven to 150C/300F/Gas 2 and line a 20cm/8in square baking tin with baking paper.",
        "Melt the butter in a medium pan over a low heat. Dip a brush in the butter and brush the baking tin with a little bit of it. Add the golden syrup and sugar to the butter and heat gently. Once the sugar is dissolved and the butter is melted, remove the pan from the heat and stir in the porridge oats, lemon zest and ginger.",
