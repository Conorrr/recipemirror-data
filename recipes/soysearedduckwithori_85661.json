        "Heat a small ovenproof frying pan until very hot, place the duck into the pan skin-side down and fry for 2-3 minutes. Pour off any excess fat released by the duck. Reduce the heat and cook for a further five minutes, or until golden-brown. Turn over and cook skin-side up for three minutes. Add the soy sauce to the pan and stir well.",
        "Transfer to the oven and cook the duck for five minutes, or until cooked to your liking.",

        "To serve, place the noodle salad into two serving bowls. Cut the duck into slices and place on top of the noodles. Sprinkle over the remaining sesame seeds."
