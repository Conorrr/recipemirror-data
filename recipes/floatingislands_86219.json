        "Place the egg whites into a clean, dry bowl and whisk with an electric hand whisk until stiff peaks form when the whisk is removed. Gradually add the sugar one tablespoon at a time until all the sugar is incorporated and the mixture is glossy.",
        "Half-fill a medium saucepan with boiling water, add the vanilla seeds and bring to a gentle boil.",
        "Using two tablespoons, make quenelles (large spoonfuls) of meringue mixture and then drop the quenelles into the boiling vanilla water. Poach for 2-3 minutes, turn over, drizzle with honey and poach for another 2-3 minutes.",
        "Carefully spoon onto a plate and repeat with the rest of the meringue mix."
