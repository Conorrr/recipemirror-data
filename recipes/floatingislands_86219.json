        "Place the egg whites into a clean, dry bowl and whisk with an electric hand whisk until stiff peaks form when the whisk is removed. Gradually add the sugar one tablespoon at a time until all the sugar is incorporated and the mixture is glossy.",

        "Using two tablespoons, make quenelles (large spoonfuls) of meringue mixture and then drop the quenelles into the boiling vanilla water. Poach for 2-3 minutes, turn over, drizzle with honey and poach for another 2-3 minutes.",
        "Carefully spoon onto a plate and repeat with the rest of the meringue mix."
