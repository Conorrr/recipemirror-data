        "Blend the chopped chilli, garlic, ginger and palm sugar to a fine paste in a food processor. Add the soy and fish sauces and blend again. Taste and adjust the seasoning if necessary.",
        "Heat a frying pan over a medium to high heat. Add the lamb slices and fry for 2-3 minutes, or until crisp on one side. Add half of the chilli-and-ginger dressing and continue to cook until the lamb slices are coated in it and it is heated through. Remove the sticky lamb from the pan and set aside.",
        "In a bowl, mix together the cucumber, peas, sugarsnap peas, beansprouts, spring onions, mint leaves and coriander until well combined. Add enough of the remaining dressing to coat the ingredients, then gradually drizzle in the lime juice, tasting regularly. Add the pea shoots and mix well.",
        "To serve, divide the salad equally among four serving plates. Top each serving with some of the lamb. Drizzle over a little more of the dressing, then sprinkle with the finely sliced chilli and serve immediately."
