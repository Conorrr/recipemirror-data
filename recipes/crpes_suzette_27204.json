        "For the cr\u00eapes, place the flour into a bowl. Add the egg, melted butter and milk and whisk to a smooth batter. Set aside for at least one hour, preferably overnight.",
        "Heat a frying pan until medium hot, melt a little butter in the pan, then add a ladle of batter and swirl to coat the bottom of the pan. Cook for 1-2 minutes, then flip and cook for a further minute.",
        "Slide the cr\u00eape from the pan and place on greaseproof paper. Repeat with the remaining batter, layering the cr\u00eapes with greaseproof paper as you go. The cr\u00eapes can be chilled or frozen at this point and used later.",
        "For the sauce, heat a frying pan until hot, add the butter, orange zest and juice, lemon zest and juice and the caster sugar.",
        "Cook for a few minutes until just thickened and bubbling, then remove the pan from the heat.",
        "Fold the cr\u00eapes into quarters and carefully lay into the hot sauce. Return the pan to the heat then add the orange liqueur and brandy and flame to burn off the alcohol. (CAUTION: Keep your face and hair away from the flames. Do not leave the pan unattended.)",
        "Cook for a couple of minutes until the cr\u00eapes are heated through.",
        "To serve, spoon the cr\u00eapes onto serving plates and spoon the sauce over the top."
