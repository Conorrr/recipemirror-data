        "Chill the chia mixture in the fridge for at least 4 hours, or preferably overnight.",
        "To serve, divide the chia pudding equally among 4 serving bowls. Garnish with the reserved raspberries, toasted nuts and orange zest."

    "tips": [
        "As an alternative to the cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche you can use 80g/3oz cahsews. Put the cashews in a bowl and pour over 500ml/17fl oz of cold water. Soak for 3 hours, then drain well and rinse under cold running water."
