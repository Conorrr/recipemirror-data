        "Preheat the oven to 200C/400F/Gas 6.",

        "Add the honey and cook for two minutes.",
        "Cut out a circle of the puff pastry, the same width as the frying pan. Place the pastry over the cooked onions and prick the pastry with a fork. Place into the oven to cook for 10 minutes.",
        "For the pesto, place the basil leaves and pine nuts into a food processor and blend together. Gradually pour in the olive oil, until the pesto reaches a pouring consistency. Season well with salt and freshly ground black pepper.",
        "Remove the tart from the oven and transfer onto a serving plate. Place the goats' cheese on top.",
        "To serve, pour the pesto around the tart and serve immediately."
