        "Heat the vegetable oil in a deep heavy-bottomed saucepan, until a breadcrumb sizzles and browns when dropped in it. (CAUTION: hot oil can be dangerous - do not leave unattended!)",
        "Brush four sheets of filo pastry with oil. Arrange one on top of each other and place a scoop of ice cream in the middle of each.",
        "Roll up the pastry around the ice cream like a spring roll and seal the end by brushing with oil. Repeat this twice more with the remaining filo squares and ice cream.",
        "Carefully place the rolls into the hot oil and deep-fry for 2-3 minutes, until crisp and golden. Carefully remove with a slotted spoon and drain onto kitchen towels.",
        "To serve, place the rolls onto a plate, sprinkle with paprika and drizzle with the honey."
