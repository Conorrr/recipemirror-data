        "For the pickle, put the beetroot in a bowl and season with the sugar and allspice, a pinch of salt and a grind of pepper. Mix well and set aside for a few minutes. Drain off any excess liquid, then trickle over the vinegar and mix well.",
        "For the fritters, put the potatoes in a bowl and season with salt, pepper and the caraway seeds. Mix in the spring onions and cheese. Pour in the egg and beer, stir, then mix in the flour to make a thick batter.",
        "Pour 2.5cm/one inch oil into a deep saucepan and heat to 180C/350F. To test if it's hot enough, dribble some of the batter into the hot oil. It should sizzle and turn golden-brown after a minute or so. Watch the pan. Carefully lower tablespoons of the batter into the hot oil and cook for one minute, then turn and cook the other side until golden and firm. Transfer to kitchen paper using a slotted spoon.",
        "Season with a little salt and pepper and serve with the pickled beetroot."
