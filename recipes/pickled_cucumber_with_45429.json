    "description": "My obsession with pickles started when my mother used to send me off to school with a packed lunch of cold rice, pickles and stir-fried meat and vegetables. The pickles add a salty-sour flavour that is very 'xia fan' \u2013 they make plain rice more palatable. This delicious recipe is a quick pickling technique, and the pickle should be eaten within a few days while the cucumbers still retain their crunch and freshness.",
