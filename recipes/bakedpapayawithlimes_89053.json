        "Preheat the oven to 180C/350F/Gas 4.",
        "Place the papaya into a small baking tray, cut side up.",
        "Melt half the butter in a small saucepan and add the lime juice and sugar, stirring until the sugar has dissolved. Pour the mixture over the papaya, add the lemon wedges to the tray and then place in the oven and bake for 6-8 minutes, or until the papaya is tender. Remove the papaya from the oven and transfer to a serving plate along with the roasted lemon wedges.",
        "Place the baking tray over a medium heat, add a splash of water and the rest of the butter and stir until melted. Drizzle the mixture over the papaya and serve with a dollop of Greek-style yoghurt."
