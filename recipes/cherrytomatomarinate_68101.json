        "default": [
            "350g/12oz feta (enough to make 40 squares)",
            "120ml/4fl oz extra virgin olive oil",
            "1 unwaxed lemon, zest only",
            "2 tsp freshly chopped oregano",
            "1 tsp cracked black pepper",
            "40 cherry tomatoes",
            "large bunch of basil",

    },
    "steps": [
        "Cut the feta into 40 even squares and place in a bowl. Pour over the olive oil; add the lemon zest, oregano and cracked black pepper. Leave to marinate for at least 2 hours or preferably overnight.",
        "To assemble, take a skewer and place a cherry tomato first, follow with a cube of the feta. You could prepare the skewers to this stage in advance, just keep refrigerated.",
        "Finish each one with a basil leaf. Skewer one tip of the leaf then the other tip so it looks like a little sail. Repeat until you have forty skewers."
