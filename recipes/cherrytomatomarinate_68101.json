        "Cut the feta into 40 even squares and place in a bowl. Pour over the olive oil; add the lemon zest, oregano and cracked black pepper. Leave to marinate for at least 2 hours or preferably overnight.",
        "To assemble, take a skewer and place a cherry tomato first, follow with a cube of the feta. You could prepare the skewers to this stage in advance, just keep refrigerated.",
        "Finish each one with a basil leaf. Skewer one tip of the leaf then the other tip so it looks like a little sail. Repeat until you have forty skewers."
