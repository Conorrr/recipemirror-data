        "To make the mashed potato, place the potato into a pan of boiling salted water and simmer for about 15 minutes, or until tender.",
        "Meanwhile, heat a heavy-bottomed frying pan over a medium heat and add the oil and a knob of the butter. Season the pheasant with salt and freshly ground black pepper and add to the pan. Saut\u00e9 the pheasant for 2-3 minutes until lightly golden on all sides.",
        "Carefully add the brandy to the pan to flamb\u00e9 the pheasant. Add the cream, stir and heat through. Season, to taste, with salt and freshly ground black pepper and stir in the chives.",
        "For the mashed potato, drain the cooked potato thoroughly, return to the pan and mash to a smooth pur\u00e9e. Beat in the remaining butter and season, to taste, with salt and freshly ground black pepper.",
        "Spoon the mashed potato on to a warm serving plate and place the pheasant on top. Drizzle the sauce around the pheasant and serve at once."
