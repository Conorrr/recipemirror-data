    "description": "This spicy Asian soup is great for a dinner party - guests choose what goes into their soup, then ladle over the spicy broth. Make sure you have separate utensils for your guests to use to transfer the raw ingredients into the stockpot, and clean utensils for eating - this reduces the chance of cross contamination from the raw ingredients and your guests' serving plates.",
