    "steps": [
        "Generously butter the inside of two 1.2 litre/2 pint pudding basins.",
        "Spoon the jam into the base of the pudding basin and set aside.",
        "Beat the butter, golden syrup and sugar together in a mixer until light and fluffy.",
        "Beat in half the eggs followed by half the flour and when well combined, add the remaining eggs and flour. The mixture should be at a dropping consistency. Add a splash of milk if the mixture is too thick.",
        "Spoon the mixture into the pudding basins, only filling them three quarters full, then smooth the surface with the back of a spoon.",
        "Loosely cover with cling film, allowing room for the cling film to inflate as the mixture rises, and cook in the microwave for five minutes.The pudding is done when a skewer inserted into the centre of the pudding comes out clean.",
        "Leave to stand for five minutes then run a blunt knife around the edge of the pudding to loosen the sides, carefully invert onto a deep plate and remove the basin.",
        "To serve, spoon the extra jam over the pudding, cut into generous wedges and serve with custard."
