            "100g/3\u00bdoz crystallised ginger, finely sliced",
            "800g/1lb 12\u00bcoz pears coared and cut into wedges",
            "\u00bd tsp sea salt",

    "steps": [
        "Heat a large saucepan with the oil, add the rosemary, sultanas, raisins and sugar and fry them until the fruit begins to caramelise.",
        "Pour in the vinegar and boil on a high heat for three minutes. Then add the rest of the ingredients, bring to the boil, then turn to a simmer and cook until most of the liquid has evaporated. Because of the fruit, this chutney has a tendency to stick to the bottom of the pan, so stir it well and keep an eye on it. Don't let the pears cook too much; they should keep their shape.",
        "Spoon it into clean hot jars, filling them as full as you can, and seal while hot. Store in the fridge."
