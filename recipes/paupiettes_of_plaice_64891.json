        "Place into a steamer and cook for 4-5 minutes, or until just cooked through.",
        "Blend the coriander leaves and olive oil in a food processor to a fine pur\u00e9e. Pass through a fine sieve into a bowl.",
        "For the cauliflower pur\u00e9e, cook the cauliflower florets in boiling water for 4-5 minutes, or until just tender, and drain.",
        "Blend with the butter and cream in a food processerto a pur\u00e9e. Season with salt and freshly ground black pepper.",
        "For the soused turnip, heat the vinegar, sugar and salt in a saucepan until simmering. Pour the mixture over the sliced turnip and mix until well combined. Set aside to marinate for five minutes (or up to 24 hours). Drain the turnip slices and discard the sousing liquid.",
        "To serve, spoon the cauliflower pur\u00e9e into the centre of the serving plates and place three paupiettes of plaice on top. Pile a spoonful of crabmeat on top then finish with a few pieces of turnip. Scatter the coriander cress around and drizzle over some coriander oil."
