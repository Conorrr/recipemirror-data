        "Preheat the oven to 180C/350F/Gas 4.",

        "Add the apricots cut-side down and cook for 2-3 minutes. Turn the apricots over and sprinkle over the pine nuts.",
        "Place the flour, the remaining sugar and the butter into a food processor and pulse until the mixture resembles breadcrumbs.",

        "Transfer to the oven and bake for 10-12 minutes, or until golden-brown.",
        "To serve, turn the pudding out onto a plate and drizzle with cream."
