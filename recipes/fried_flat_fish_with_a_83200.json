        "Add the stock and bring to a simmer. Cook for 4-5 minutes, or until the shallot has softened and the volume of liquid has reduced slightly. Stir in the butter, cream and parsley. Season, to taste, with plenty of black pepper.",
        "For the fish, heat the oil in a medium frying pan. Once hot, add the fish skin-side down in the pan and cook for 2-3 minutes on each side. Add the butter and baste the fish with it as it melts.",
        "To serve, place the beans in serving bowls and top with the fish."
