        "Tip 1: The chicken is best mixed in the dressing a day ahead to allow the flavours to infuse, while the salad should be made fresh on the day. Tip 2: Micro salad is as it sounds \u2013 mini leaves that are pretty and full of flavour. If you can\u2019t get hold of micro salad, then a bag of mixed salad leaves or even watercress would make a good alternative. Tip 3: Freeze any leftover fresh pesto and use within one month."
