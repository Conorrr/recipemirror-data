        "For the sweet shortcrust pastry, grease and flour a 30cm/12in tart tin.",
        "Place the flour, caster sugar and chopped cold butter into a bowl or food processor. Gently rub the ingredients together with your fingertips or blend until the mixture resembles breadcrumbs.",
        "Add the beaten eggs and combine to form a light dough (add 2-3 tablespoons of water if needed).",
        "Form the dough into a ball and transfer to the fridge to chill for 30 minutes.",
        "Preheat the oven to 180C/350F/Gas 4.",
        "On a lightly floured work surface, roll out the dough to 5mm/\u00bcin thick.",
        "Line the prepared tart tin with the pastry and trim any excess from the edges. Any unused pastry can be frozen for later use.",
        "Lay a piece of greaseproof paper over the pastry and fill with baking beans or dry pulses. Bake blind for 15-20 minutes at until dry and firm to touch.",
        "Remove the pastry case from the oven. Remove the baking beans and greaseproof paper. Set aside.",
        "For the filling, drain the liquid from the curd cheese by placing it in a sieve. Use the back of a spoon to squeeze out any excess moisture. Discard the liquid.",
        "In a bowl, beat the sugar and butter until smooth and pale.",
        "Add the flour, raisins, egg, curd cheese, lemon zest and nutmeg. Mix well.",
        "Spread the lemon curd over the pastry base, then fill with the curd cheese mix. Smooth the surface with a pallet knife or the back of a spoon.",
        "Bake for 35-40 minutes, or until the pastry is golden-brown and the filling set.",
        "Allow the tart to cool in the tin for 20-25 minutes.",
        "Remove from the tin and serve in slices."
