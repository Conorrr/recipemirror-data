        "Place the flour into a large bowl. Add the courgette strips and toss to coat thoroughly.",

        "Heat the oil in a deep, heavy-bottomed pan. The oil is ready when a breadcrumb dropped into it will sizzle gently. (CAUTION: Hot oil can be very dangerous. Do not leave unattended.)",
        "Carefully add the courgette strips and deep-fry until golden. Remove with a slotted spoon and drain on kitchen towels.",
