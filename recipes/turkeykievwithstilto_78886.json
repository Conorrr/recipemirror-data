        "Heat the vegetable oil in a heavy bottomed saucepan, until a breadcrumb sizzles in it. (CAUTION: hot oil can be dangerous! Do not leave unattended.)",
        "Using a sharp knife, carefully cut along the side of the turkey breast to create a pocket in the breast. Stuff the pocket with the Stilton.",
        "Dredge the stuffed breast in the flour to coat. Then dip in the beaten egg and then dredge in the breadcrumbs, ensuring a full coating.",
        "Carefully place the stuffed breast into the hot oil and cook for 4-5 minutes, until golden and thoroughly cooked. Remove carefully from the oil and drain on kitchen towels.",
        "For the onions, place all of the balsamic onion ingredients in a small frying pan and cook over a medium to high heat for five minutes, or until lightly caramelised.",
