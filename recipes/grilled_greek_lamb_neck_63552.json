        "To complete the lamb, slice the watermelon and arrange on four plates and scatter with orange segments and red onion (squeeze any orange juice from cutting the segments into the dressing).",
        "Heat a griddle pan, season the lamb fillets and cook them to your liking, turning regularly (6-7 minutes for medium rare). Set aside, in a warm place, to rest.",
        "Drizzle some feta cream over the watermelon, slice the lamb thinly and arrange it over the melon. Scatter with mint leaves and drizzle with the lemon-chilli dressing."
