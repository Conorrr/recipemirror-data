        "Trim the wing bone and tidy up the skin on the chicken.",
        "Turn the supreme over and remove the fillet and carefully open up a cavity with a boning knife.",
        "Blanch a handful of baby spinach and refresh in cold water, drain and squeeze dry.",
        "Fry the oyster mushrooms in olive oil and allow to cool.",
        "Mix the spinach and mushrooms together, season and add a few pine nuts.",
        "Put this mixture in the cavity of the chicken, then replace the fillet. Lightly coat the chicken in some ground cumin, then wrap the chicken in thinly sliced pancetta, seal it in a hot pan with some olive oil and roast in the oven for 10-12 minutes at 160C/325F/Gas 3.",
        "Using an apple corer, cut cylindrical chips from a raw orange fleshed sweet potato. Cook in boiling water for about 4 minutes and allow to cool. Pan-fry the chips in some vegetable oil until they go a golden roasted colour (about 2/3 minutes).",
        "Cut the tomato into fine dice, add the finely chopped mint leaves and onion and a few drops of olive oil. Serve with the chicken and sweet potato."
