            "2 tsp cumin seeds",
            "1 red chilli, split lengthways",
            "5cm/2in piece root ginger, peeled and grated",
            "4 plump garlic cloves, peeled and crushed",

            "salt, to taste",
            "\u00bc tsp ground turmeric"

    "steps": [
        "Finely slice the spring greens and wash them thoroughly - this isn't just to remove any grit, but also because, as there's no liquid added to this dish, the water clinging to the leaves will ensure that the greens cook quickly and evenly.",
        "Heat the oil in a large lidded pan and add the cumin seeds. When they begin to pop, reduce the heat and add the chilli, ginger and garlic.",
        "Add the turnips, salt and turmeric, cover the pan with a lid and cook for ten minutes.",
        "Add the spring greens and cook, covered, for a further ten minutes, stirring occasionally, until they are tender but still brightly coloured and slightly crunchy.",
        "Serve hot as a side dish, removing the chilli before serving if you wish."
