    "steps": [
        "Preheat the oven to 180 C/350 F/Gas 4.",
        "Peel the onions and slice into 2.5cm (1in) slices. Gently fry in a little butter over a medium-to-high heat until the onions begin to colour - approximately 3-5 minutes. Leave to cool.",
        "Wipe the remaining butter around the base of a clean, small, ovenproof frying pan and sprinkle the sugar over the butter. Place the cold, cooked onions on top of the sugar and butter in the pan.",
        "Cut a disc of puff pastry 2cm (\u00bein) larger in diameter than the pan containing the onions, butter and sugar.",
        "Lay the pastry on top of the onions. The pastry should go up the side of the pan a little way, or over the edges to seal (this will depend on the height of your pan).",
        "Transfer the pan to the fridge and chill for one hour.",
        "Meanwhile, in a separate pan, reduce the balsamic vinegar over a medium-high heat to make a glaze.",
        "Remove the uncooked tart from the fridge and cook in the oven for 10-15 minutes until the pastry is cooked and golden.",
        "To turn out the tart, carefully place a plate over the pan and quickly turn the pan over (you may need to run a knife around the edge). The tart should be onion-side up, so the pastry has become the base.",
        "Place the slices of goats' cheese on top of the tart, and drizzle with the balsamic glaze."
