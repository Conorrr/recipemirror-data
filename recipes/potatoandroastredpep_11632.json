        "Add the milk. pur\u00e9e the soup in a blender or food processor. Taste and adjust seasoning.",
        "Just before serving, swirl the red pepper pur\u00e9e through the soup or simply drizzle on top of each bowl. Top with some snipped flat parsley. You might try adding one or two roast chillies to the pepper for a little extra buzz - serrano or jalapeno are good."
