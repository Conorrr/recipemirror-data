        "Wash the rice well in a fine sieve under cold running water, then drain.",
        "Place the rice into a saucepan and cover with 2.5cm/1in cold water. Bring the rice up to the boil over a moderate heat. Once boiling, stir the rice once, then turn the heat to very low and cover it with a tight-fitting lid for ten minutes, or until tender.",
        "Heat the vegetable oil in a frying pan or wok. Add the chicken and garlic and stir-fry for 3-4 minutes.",
        "Add the raisins and tomato and fry for a further three minutes, or until the chicken is golden all over and completely cooked through. Season, to taste, with salt and freshly ground black pepper.",
