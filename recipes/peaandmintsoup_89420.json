        "Bring the water to the boil in a large pan and add a generous pinch of salt.",
        "Add the mint leaves and bring the liquid back to the boil.",
        "Add the peas and cook for 2-3 minutes, until the peas are just tender and bright green.",
        "Strain the mint and peas, reserving the cooking liquid, and transfer the peas and mint to a food processor. Allow to cool for 3-4 minutes.",
        "Add just enough of the cooking liquid to cover the peas and mint, then blend for 1-2 minutes, to create a smooth, bright green pur\u00e9e.",
        "Season, to taste, with salt and freshly ground black pepper and add a generous drizzle of olive oil.",
        "Add 140ml/4\u00bdfl oz of the cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche to the pea and mint pur\u00e9e and pulse in the blender for a few seconds, until combined.",
        "To serve, pour equal amounts of the soup into four warmed bowls. Add a neat tablespoon of cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche into the centre of each and, if you wish, garnish with the crisp Parma ham."
