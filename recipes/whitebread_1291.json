        "Mix the yeast with a little of the milk to get a creamy liquid.",
        "Put the flour and the salt in a bowl and rub in the butter.",
        "Stir in the yeast liquid and the rest of the milk to get a soft dough.",
        "Turn on to a lightly floured work surface and knead until the dough is smooth and elastic, about 10-15 minutes. Put in a clean bowl and cover with clingfilm. Stand in a warm place for 1 hour to rise.",
        "Heat the oven to 220C/425F/Gas 7. Lightly oil a 1kg/2\u00bclb bread tin.",
        "Turn the dough on to the work surface again and knead for 5-10 minutes. Shape the dough into a loaf shape to fit the tin and place in the tin. Cover with a clean tea towel and allow to rise back up again, about 15 minutes.",
        "Bake in the oven until golden and risen, about 30-40 minutes. The base of the loaf should sound hollow when you tap it. Turn on to a wire rack to cool."
