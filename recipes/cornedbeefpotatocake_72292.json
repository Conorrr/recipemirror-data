        "To make the chutney, heat a saucepan with a drizzle of olive oil, the red onion and the chilli. Cook until browned.",
        "Add the tomato, brown sugar and seasoning, and allow to caramelise for five minutes.",
        "Serve either hot or cold with the potato cakes and some ripped salad leaves."
