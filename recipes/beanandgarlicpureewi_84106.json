        "For the naan breads, mix together the flour, herbs and salt in a bowl and make a hole in the centre.",
        "Pour water slowly into the centre, and mix from the centre outwards, until it becomes a smooth, soft dough. Shape the dough into six flat ovals and place onto a hot frying pan and dry fry for for three minutes on each side.",
        "To serve, cut the naan breads into strips and serve alongside the pure\u00e9e."
