        "For the burger, place the steak, onion, garlic and chilli in a food processor and pulse until minced. Season with salt and freshly ground black pepper and shape into a patty.",

        "Drizzle the cut sides of the baguette with the remaining oil and fry, oiled-side down, until lightly toasted, pressing down with a spatula if necessary.",
        "For the relish, heat the oil in a small saucepan and fry the pepper and chilli together for 2-3 minutes, or until the pepper starts to soften.",
        "Add the remaining ingredients and simmer for 4-5 minutes.",
        "To serve, place the burger inside the baguette, sprinkle with cheese and top with a dollop of relish."
