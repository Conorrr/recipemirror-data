        "This could easily be turned into a vegetarian dish, by using a mixture of vegetable stock and liquor from soaking dried mushrooms. You wouldn\u2019t need much dried mushrooms, just around 15g/\u00bdoz to add flavour, and they would just need to be finely chopped before adding to the soup at the same time as the cabbage."
