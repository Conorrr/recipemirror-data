            "2 fist-sized pieces ciabatta bread, or any other unsliced loaf",
            "2 anchovy fillets",
            "3 tbsp drained capers",
            "4 tbsp olive oil",
            "1 tbsp red wine vinegar",
            "600g/1lb 2oz tomatoes, chopped",
            "1 bag mixed salad leaves",
            "salt and pepper"

    "steps": [
        "Preheat the oven to 110C/225F/Gas \u00bc or its lowest setting.",
        "Rip the bread into bite-sized pieces, place on a baking tray and bake for about 20 minutes. Make sure it doesn't burn - what you're looking for is bread that comes out feeling a little stale.",
        "Meanwhile, put the anchovies, two tablespoons of the capers, the oil and vinegar in a pestle and mortar and smash it into a dressing.",
        "Grab yourself a big mixing bowl and put in the tomatoes and bread and pour on the dressing, then get stuck in with your hands. Give it all a gentle squeeze to make sure the spongy bread soaks up all the juices.",
        "Finally tip your salad leaves onto a serving plate and drop the contents of the bowl over the top, finishing off with the remaining capers and some salt and pepper."
