    "steps": [
        "Heat the oil in a large, heavy-based frying pan over a medium heat. Add the onions and fry for 8-10 minutes, stirring regularly, until softened and lightly browned. Add the ginger, garlic and chilli flakes, stir well and cook for 2-3 minutes, making sure the garlic doesn't burn.",
        "Season the beef all over with pepper, then sprinkle over the five-spice powder and mix to coat evenly. Add to the pan and fry for 3-4 minutes, turning the beef regularly until lightly browned all over.",
        "Transfer to the slow-cooker. Pour over the stock and stir in the soy sauce. Cover and cook on high for 4 hours, until the beef is meltingly tender.",
        "When the beef is cooked, whisk the cornflour with 1 tablespoon water to a smooth paste, stir in the honey. Add to the slow-cooker, cover and cook for 12-15 minutes, or until the sauce is glossy and has thickened slightly.",
        "Serve the beef with steamed rice or boiled noodles and stir-fried vegetables."

    "tips": [
        "If you are using pre-cut beef, it will probably be in small chunks, so reduce the cooking time by about 1 hour. Also, If you are not using a slow cooker you may need to add extra beef stock."
