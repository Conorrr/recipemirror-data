        "Cut each sponge in half horizontally so that you have four layers.",
        "Whip the cream until stiff and fold in the kirsch. Put about a quarter of the cream one side for the decoration.",
        "Reserve six evenly-sized strawberries and slice the remainder. 7. Spread each layer of sponge with cream and top with strawberries. Make sure you leave enough cream to coat the top and sides of the gateau. Smooth the top.",
        "Coat the sides of the gateau with toasted almonds. Use the reserved cream to pipe rosettes on the top. Halve the reserved strawberries and use to decorate.",
        "Chill until required."
