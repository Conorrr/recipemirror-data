    "description": "Hong Ying is a well-known writer and a great cook. At her local market in Beijing I found a beautiful head of cabbage, a real staple in Beijing kitchens, and some lovely dried shrimp, which inspired me to cook this dish. Since Hong Ying is from Sichuan, I threw in some chilli bean paste too.",
