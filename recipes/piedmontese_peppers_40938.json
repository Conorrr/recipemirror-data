    "ingredients": {
        "default": [
            "8-12 ripe plum tomatoes",
            "4 red peppers, stalks left on (for decoration), cut lengthways in half, seeds removed",
            "4 garlic cloves, sliced",
            "5-6 tbsp extra virgin olive oil",
            "salt and freshly ground black pepper",
            "8 large canned anchovies, cut in half lengthways",
            "small handful fresh basil"
        ]
    },
    "steps": [
        "Preheat the oven to 190C/375F/Gas 5.",
        "Pour boiling water over the plum tomatoes, leave for 10 seconds, carefully remove from the water and refresh in a bowl of cold water. Peel off the tomato skins.",
        "Place the halved peppers into an ovenproof dish (preferably one that will be nice enough to present later), cut-side up.",
        "Place the garlic inside the peppers and then fit the tomatoes inside too, pushing them gently into the space. Add a small pinch of salt and a grinding of freshly ground black pepper. Spoon over the olive oil and then place into the oven. Bake for about 45 minutes to one hour, turning the heat down a little if you notice any excessive scorching of the peppers.",
        "Once they are nicely softened and have slightly collapsed, remove the peppers from the oven. Criss-cross each pepper half with an anchovy, baste with the oily juices and allow to cool to room temperature.",
        "Top with basil leaves and serve."
