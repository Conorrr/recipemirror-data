        "For the mango salsa": [
            "4 tbsp red onion, finely chopped",
            "2 ripe mangoes, peeled and cut into 1cm (\u00bdin) dice",
            "4 tbsp lime or lemon juice",
            "1-2 red chillies, finely diced",
            "1 tbsp sugar",
            "2 tbsp fresh mint, chopped",

    "steps": [
        "Season the duck breasts with salt and freshly ground green peppercorns, then place them, skin-side down, on a heated griddle pan.",
        "Turn the duck breasts.",
        "Cook for a few minutes, skin-side up, then turn them again to crisp up the skin.",
        "Continue this process until the duck is cooked to your taste.",
        "To make the salsa, first scald the red onion by pouring boiling water over it and draining it off immediately (this softens the raw flavour of the onion, which can slightly overpower the other ingredients).",
        "Mix together with the remaining salsa ingredients and allow the flavours to combine for \u00bd an hour.",
        "Taste the salsa, adding a little more lime, sugar or salt if desired.",
        "Garnish the duck breasts with parsley and serve with plenty of salsa on the side. Serve with Asian crispy noodles."
