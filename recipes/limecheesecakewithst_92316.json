        "Put two 10cm/4in diameter chefs' rings on two plates. Line the edges with strawberry slices.",
        "Whisk the cream in a mixing bowl until it forms soft peaks. Stir in the Greek-style yoghurt, condensed milk and lime zest. Add the lime juice, to thicken the mixture.",
        "Spoon the cream mixture into the strawberry-lined rings and level off the top. Place in the fridge to set for 5-10 minutes, or longer if possible.",
        "Release the cheesecakes from the rings by heating carefully with a cook's blowtorch around the outside. Drizzle with the melted chocolate and serve."
