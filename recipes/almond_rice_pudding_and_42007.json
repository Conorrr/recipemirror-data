Heat slowly, stirring constantly, until the sugar has dissolved, then simmer for around 10 minutes until the cherries are slightly softened. Mix the arrowroot with a little water and stir until smooth. Add to the cherries as they are simmering and stir until the sauce has slightly thickened. Add the kirsch, if using.",
