        "For the steamed salmon, place the salmon into a bamboo steamer set over a wok half-filled with boiling water. Squeeze over the lemon, add the white wine and season with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Cover tightly with a lid and steam for 6-7 minutes, or until the salmon is cooked through.",
        "For the stir-fried green beans, heat the olive oil in a wok, add the onion and fry for 3-4 minutes, or until softened but not coloured. Add the garlic, green beans and soy sauce and stir-fry for 3-4 minutes, or until the green beans are cooked with still a bit of crunch, then squeeze over the lemon juice, to taste.",
        "For the fragrant rice, place the rice into a pan of boiling salted water and cook for 8-10 minutes, or until the rice is tender. Drain well and then stir in the chopped herbs and watercress and season with salt and freshly ground black pepper.",
        "To serve, pile the rice on to a serving plate, spoon over the stir-fried green beans and top with the steamed salmon."
