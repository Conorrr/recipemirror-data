            "225g/8oz self-raising flour",
            "75g/2\u00bdoz caster sugar",
            "1 tsp baking powder",
            "125g/4\u00bdoz unsalted butter, cut into cubes",
            "150g/5\u00bdoz dried fruit",
            "1 free-range egg",
            "1 tbsp milk",
            "2 tsp vanilla extract"

    "steps": [
        "Preheat oven to 180C/350F/Gas 4 and line a baking tray with baking parchment.",
        "Mix the flour, sugar and baking powder in a bowl and rub in the cubed butter until the mixture looks like breadcrumbs, then mix in the dried fruit.",
        "In a clean bowl, beat the egg and milk together with the vanilla extract.",
        "Add the egg mixture to the dry ingredients and stir with a spoon until the mixture just comes together as a thick, lumpy dough. Add a teaspoon more milk if you really need it to make the mixture stick together.",
        "Place golfball-sized spoons of the mixture onto the prepared baking tray. Leave space between them as they will flatten and spread out to double their size during baking.",
        "Bake for 15-20 minutes, until golden-brown. Remove from the oven, allow to cool for a couple of minutes then turn them out onto a wire rack to cool."
