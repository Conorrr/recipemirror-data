        "Drizzle with the cream, and scatter with sea salt, pepper, parsley and parmesan.",
        "Bake for 15-20 minutes until the egg is just set and starting to shrink away from the sides of the tin.",
        "Leave to cool for five minutes, then run a knife around each mould to loosen the ham and egg, and remove to a wire tray. Eat warm, or at room temperature.",
        "Serve with a handful of herb and baby leaf salad."
