        "Put the celeriac in a bowl and cover with approximately 100ml/3\u00bdfl oz cold water. Add the lemon juice. Toss well to prevent it going brown.",

    "tips": [
        "For the best results, use a mandolin to slice the celeriac into matchsticks. However, if you\u2019re pressed for time, a food processor gives good results. Use the largest grating attachment to give a coarse grating, rather than matchsticks."
