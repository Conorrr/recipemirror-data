        "Preheat the oven to 200C/400F/Gas 6.",
        "For the spiced monkfish, place the curry powder and paprika into a bowl and mix well. Dip the monkfish into the bowl to coat on all sides, shaking off any excess.",
        "Place the monkfish onto a baking tray and drizzle with oil. Transfer to the oven and bake for ten minutes, or until completely cooked through.",
        "Meanwhile, for the crushed potato cake, place the cooked potatoes into a bowl with the butter and lightly crush with a fork or potato masher. Add the dill, season, to taste, with salt and freshly ground black pepper and mix well to combine. Set aside and keep warm.",
        "For the sweet and sour cherries, place all the sweet and sour cherries ingredients into a pan and simmer until the sauce has thickened enough to coat the back of a spoon.",
        "To serve, lightly grease a chefs' ring on a serving plate and press the crushed potato into the ring. Remove the ring, top the potato cake with the monkfish and pour over the sweet and sour cherries."
