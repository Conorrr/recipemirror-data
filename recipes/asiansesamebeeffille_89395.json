        "For the Asian sesame beef fillet, heat a frying pan over a medium heat. Rub the sesame oil into the steak and fry the meat for 2-3 minutes on each side, or until cooked to your taste. Sprinkle the sesame seeds over the steak, then remove the meat from the pan. Set aside to rest.",

        "To serve, arrange the orange slices on a serving plate and spoon the orange and vegetable salad into the centre. Place the sesame beef fillet on top of the salad, and garnish with the chervil sprig."
