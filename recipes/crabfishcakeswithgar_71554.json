    "steps": [
        "Melt one tablespoon of the butter in a small saucepan and sweat the pepper, spring onion and celery until soft, about five minutes. Allow to cool and then place in a bowl.",
        "Process the fresh fish in a food processor to make a rough pur\u00e9e. Add the crabmeat, egg, herbs, mustard and 100g/3\u00bdoz of the breadcrumbs. Taste for seasoning and add salt and pepper if necessary.",
        "Roll the crabmeat mixture into balls just a little larger than a golf ball and dip in the remaining breadcrumbs.",
        "Finally form the balls into little cakes by pressing them down lightly.",
        "Melt one tablespoon of the butter in a large frying pan with the vegetable oil. Saute the crabcakes over a moderate heat until nicely golden and heated right through. This will take about 3-4 minutes on each side (depending on thickness)",
        "Drain on kitchen paper and serve with a garlic mayonnaise.",
        "To make the mayonnaise, combine the egg yolks, garlic, one tablespoon of the lemon juice, the lemon zest and the salt in a food processor.",
        "Blend for a few seconds and then slowly add the oils in a steady stream until emulsified.",
        "Taste and adjust the amount of lemon juice and salt if necessary. Serve with the crabcakes and some green salad leaves."
