        "Roll the mixture out on a work surface and cut out four pieces the same size as the cod fillets.",
        "Meanwhile, heat the remaining olive oil in a frying pan and fry the cod, skin-side down, for 2-3 minutes.",
        "Remove the cod fillets from the pan, peel off the skin and place the parsley crust on top.",
        "Grill the cod fillets for 2-3 minutes.",
