        "For the croquettes, cook the Puy lentils according to packet instructions. Drain.",
        "Mix the Puy lentils, sweet potato, mixed herbs, breadcrumbs, nutmeg and egg yolk together in a bowl until well combined.",

        "With floured hands, mould small amounts of the mixture into 7.5cm/3in long cylinders.",
        "Dredge the croquettes in the flour, then dip into the beaten egg and finally dip into the polenta to coat completely.",
        "Heat the oil in a deep heavy-based frying pan until a breadcrumb sizzles and turns brown when dropped into it. (CAUTION: hot oil can be dangerous. Do not leave unattended.)",
        "Fry the croquettes for 2-3 minutes, or until crisp and golden-brown. Remove from the pan with a slotted spoon and set aside to drain on kitchen paper.",

        "Serve the croquettes with the raita dip alongside."

    "tips": [
        "You can prepare the croquettes in advance and chill them in the fridge. Remove from the fridge 30 minutes before cooking, and fry just before serving."
