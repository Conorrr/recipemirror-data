    "steps": [
        "For the prawn curry, heat the vegetable oil in a frying pan and gently fry the onion, chilli, garlic and ginger for five minutes, or until softened.",
        "Add the curry paste and cook for a further 4-5 minutes.",
        "Add the vinegar and prawns and cook for a further 4-5 minutes, then remove the pan from the heat.",
        "For the fritters, heat the vegetable oil in a frying pan and gently fry the onion, chilli and mustard seeds for five minutes.",
        "Add the mashed potato, turmeric, coriander and peas and stir until well combined. Remove the pan from the heat and set aside to cool slightly. When cool enough to handle, roll 75g/3oz of the mixture into a ball and flatten slightly, repeat with the remaining mixture.",
        "For the batter, mix the chickpea flour, rice flour, cayenne pepper, seasoning and six tablespoons of water together in a bowl until well combined.",
        "Half-fill a deep, heavy-based pan with vegetable oil and heat until a breadcrumb dropped in sizzles and turns golden-brown in 30 seconds. (CAUTION: Hot oil can be dangerous. Do not leave unattended)",
        "Dip the fritters in the batter and deep-fry for 2-3 minutes, or until golden-brown. Remove from the pan with a slotted spoon and set aside to drain on kitchen paper.",
        "To serve, stir the cream into the prawn curry and warm through. Serve the curry alongside the fritters."
