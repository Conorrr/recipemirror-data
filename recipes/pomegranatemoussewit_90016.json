        "Preheat the oven to 180C/350F/Gas 4.",
        "For the pomegranate mousse, whip the cream and sugar together in a bowl until soft peaks form when the whisk is removed. Gently fold in the yoghurt and the pomegranate seeds.",
        "For the shortbread, place all of the shortbread ingredients into a food processor and pulse, gradually adding enough water to bind into a dough. Tip the dough out onto a floured work surface and knead lightly to bring the dough together into a ball.",
        "Roll the dough out to a thickness of 1cm/\u00bdinch and cut into rectangles. Place onto a non-stick baking sheet and sprinkle over the caster sugar and prick the dough with a fork. Bake in the oven for 5-7 minutes, or until golden-brown.",
        "To serve, spoon the mousse into a tall serving glass and garnish with a sprig of mint. Serve the shortbread on a plate alongside."
