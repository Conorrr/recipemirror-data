        "Heat a wok until hot, add the oil and spring onions and red pepper and stir-fry for 1-2 minutes until just softened. Add the garlic and stir through, then add the broccoli and 4 tablespoons of water. Bring to the boil and simmer for 2 minutes until just tender and the water has nearly evaporated.",
        "Add the rice to the wok and stir fry for 2-3 minutes. By now the vegetables should be tender and the rice hot through. Stir in the peas cook for 1 minute. Meanwhile, in a bowl, use a fork to mix together the eggs and soy sauce.",
        "Add the eggs to the rice and continue to stir-fry for 2-3 minutes or until the eggs have just set. Stir in the sesame seeds, then season with salt and pepper and stir in the coriander. Serve immediately."
