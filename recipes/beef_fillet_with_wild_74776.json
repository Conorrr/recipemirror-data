        "For the wild garlic pur\u00e9e, melt the butter in a sauce pan. Add the shallots and garlic in and cook gently without colouring them. Add the wild garlic, chervil and tarragon and cook until the wild garlic is tender.",
        "Transfer to a blender. In a small pan bring the cream to the boil. Add this to the blender. Blend until smooth. Season with salt, to taste. Put into a plastic bottle and keep warm until serving.",
        "For the beef, season the beef with salt. Heat the oil and butter in a frying pan until foaming. Cook the beef for a few minutes on each side until cooked to your liking. Set it aside to rest before serving.",
        "For the fricassee of wild mushroom, melt 20g/\u00beoz of the butter in a pan, add the garlic and chopped shallot and cook until transparent. Add the mushrooms, season with salt and pepper and cook gently for 3 minutes. Add the Madeira to the pan and scrape the bottom of the pan. Cook until reduced by a third in volume. Add the stock and bring to the boil. Whisk in the mustard and then the rest of the butter. Season with salt and pepper and then and the tomato and tarragon just before serving.",
        "For the asparagus tips, heat a griddle pan to hot. Coat the asparagus in the oil, season with salt and pepper, then place onto the hot griddle, turning occasionally. Cook for about 5 minutes until done and ready to serve.",
