        "For the honey palmiers, preheat the oven to 200C/400F/Gas 6.",
        "Lay the pastry on a clean worksurface, brush the edges with beaten egg and drizzle half the honey over the pastry. Fold both side edges of the pastry inwards until they meet in the middle. Drizzle with the rest of the honey.",
        "Cut the pastry 'sausage' into 2.5cm/1in pieces and lay each one flat on a baking sheet. Bake for 8-10 minutes, or until puffed up and golden. Slide onto a serving plate and dust liberally with icing sugar.",
        "For the whipped honey cream, whip the double cream until it forms soft peaks when the whisk is removed. Fold in the icing sugar and honey.",
        "To serve, spoon the honey cream into a serving bowl beside the palmiers."
