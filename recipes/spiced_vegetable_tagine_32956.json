    "steps": [
        "Preheat the oven to 190C/170C Fan/Gas 5.",
        "Mix the sweet potato, aubergine, courgette and red pepper in a large bowl. Drizzle over 2 tablespoons of the oil and mix to coat. Season generously with salt and pepper.",
        "Heat a large, non-stick frying pan over a high heat. When the pan is hot, add the vegetables in batches and fry, stirring and turning regularly, for 3-4 minutes, or until lightly browned.",
        "Heat the remaining oil in a lidded casserole over a medium heat. Add the onions and fry for 3-5 minutes, stirring regularly, until softened. Add the garlic, coriander and cumin and fry for 1-2 minutes, stirring frequently.",
        "Stir in the chopped tomatoes, harissa paste, honey, apricots and chickpeas until well combined. Add the vegetables and cook for 2-3 minutes.",
        "Cover and transfer to the oven. Cook for 30 minutes, then stir in 200ml/7fl oz cold water until well combined and return to the oven, covered, for a further 15 minutes, or until the tagine is thick and the vegetables are tender.",
        "Sprinkle the tagine with the chopped coriander and serve with freshly cooked couscous or rice."
    ],
    "tips": [
        "Make sure the pan is properly hot before you cook the vegetables - otherwise they will take too long to brown and turn mushy. To freeze this dish allow it to cool completely, then pop in a freezer-proof container. It will keep in the freezer for up to 2 months. Thaw overnight in the fridge then reheat in a suitable dish in the microwave until piping hot throughout, stirring at least once."
