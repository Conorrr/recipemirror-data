        "Heat the remaining oil in the pan and fry the coated aubergine cubes for 4-5 minutes, shaking the pan occasionally, until tender and golden-brown.",
        "Return the onion mixture to the pan and stir well to combine. Squeeze over the lime juice.",
        "To serve, place one piece of griddled bread into the centre of each of four serving plates. Spoon over the spiced aubergine. Serve a dollop of the Greek-style yoghurt alongside. Sprinkle over the coriander leaves."
