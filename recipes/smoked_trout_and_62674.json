        "For the beetroot salad, simmer the beetroot in boiling water for 1\u00bd hours or until tender. Remove the beetroot from the water, allow to cool slightly, then peel. (I would recommend wearing rubber gloves when preparing the beetroots, to protect your hands from staining.)",

        "For the cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche dressing, mix the ingredients together in a bowl.",
        "To serve, arrange the beetroot salad in the centre the serving plates, top with the slices of sea trout and spoon the horseradish cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche over or around. Garnish with a few sprigs of dill."
