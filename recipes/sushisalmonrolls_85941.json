            "wasabi paste",
            "450g/1lb top quality, very fresh salmon fillet",
            "1 cucumber, thinly sliced into strips",

        "Place each square of nori flat onto a sushi rolling mat. (Sushi rolling mats are available from Asian supermarkets and larger supermarkets.)",
        "Place a layer of cooled sushi rice onto the seaweed wrap and gently press flat. (NB: don't add too much rice or you will end up with very fat sushi rolls.)",
        "Place a dab of wasabi paste along the rice, according to taste. Wasabi is quite strong, so be sparing!",
        "Place a thin slice of salmon onto the rice.",
        "Spread the strips of cucumber onto the salmon and add a sprinkling of spring onion.",
        "Carefully roll the sushi up into a sausage shape and slice it into 3cm/1in long pieces, trimming the ends.",
        "Serve with bowls of soy sauce and extra wasabi."
