        "Preheat the oven to 230C/450F/Gas 8. Cut both the aubergines in half lengthways and score the flesh in a criss-cross pattern. Brush the flesh liberally with the oil then sprinkle with 1\u00bd teaspoons of salt and some freshly ground black pepper. Place on a baking tray, flesh-side up, and roast in the oven for about 40 minutes, or until the flesh is cooked through and turns a dark golden-brown.",
        "Meanwhile, make the salsa. Mix together the walnuts, walnut pickling liquid, vinegar, garlic, chilli, walnut oil, parsley and half the coriander with one teaspoon of salt.",
        "Spoon the salsa over the aubergines as soon as they come out of the oven and leave to cool completely. Just before serving, sprinkle the remaining coriander on top along with the goats\u2019 cheese and pomegranate seeds."
