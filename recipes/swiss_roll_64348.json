        "Pour the mixture into the lined tins and bake in the oven for 10-12 minutes or until golden-brown all over.",
        "Turn the sponges out and allow to cool a little on a wire rack. Peel off the greaseproof paper.",
        "Spread the top of the sponge with jam then carefully roll up the sponge, starting with the short side, until you have a log shape.",
        "Sit the log so that the seam is on the underside and dust with icing sugar."
