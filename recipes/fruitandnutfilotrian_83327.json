        "Preheat the oven to 200C/400F/Gas 6.",
        "Brush one side of each sheet of filo pastry with a little vegetable oil and press the oiled sides together; cut into two squares.",
        "In a small bowl, mix together the apple, sultanas and spices.",
        "Arrange a little of the apple mixture on one half of each filo square, so that the pastry can be folded over diagonally. Fold each over to make a triangular parcel, seal the edges and brush with more oil.",
        "Put the triangles on a baking tray and cook for six minutes, until golden and cooked through.",
        "Serve with a couple of scoops of vanilla ice cream."
