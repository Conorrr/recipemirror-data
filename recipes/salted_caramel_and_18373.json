        "Chocolate can be tricky and sometimes seizes when temperatures change quickly, so it's always best to use eggs at room temperature. Any leftover sauce will keep for a few days in the fridge and is delicious drizzled over all sorts of desserts including ice cream, chocolate brownies and apple pie."

        "For the salted caramel sauce": [
            "100g/3\u00bdoz granulated sugar",
            "2 tbsp golden syrup",
            "30g/1oz unsalted butter",
            "80ml/2\u00befl oz double cream",
            "\u00bd tsp sea salt"
        ],
        "For the mousse": [
            "330g/11\u00bdoz dark chocolate (55-70% cocoa solids), chopped into small pieces",
            "30g/1oz unsalted butter",
            "8 free-range eggs, separated",
            "1 tbsp caster sugar",

    "steps": [
        "For the salted caramel sauce, place the sugar, two tablespoons water and golden syrup in a saucepan and bring to a boil, stirring occasionally. When the sugar has turned a rich amber colour, remove from the heat and stir in the butter, cream and salt. Pour into a bowl, cover the surface with clingfilm and cool completely.",
        "For the mousse, melt the chocolate and butter in a bowl set over a pan of simmering water - ensuring that the bottom of the bowl does not touch the water. Set aside to cool a little. Then whisk the egg yolks into the cooled chocolate mixture.",
        "In a separate bowl, whisk the egg whites to a light foam then add the caster sugar and whisk again until soft peaks form when the whisk is removed. Stir a third of the egg whites into the chocolate mixture. Then carefully fold in the remaining egg whites until well incorporated.",
        "Pour a tablespoon of salted caramel sauce into the bottom of each serving glass. Top with one-third of the mousse mixture. Drizzle over enough sauce to cover the mousse. Repeat this layering with mousse and caramel, finishing with a final layer of mousse. Refrigerate for an hour before serving. If chilled for longer, remove 30 minutes before serving. Finish with a dollop of whipped cream."
