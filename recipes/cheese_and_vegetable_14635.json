        "Preheat the oven to 220C/450F/Gas 7. Line a baking tray with baking parchment.",
        "Roll out the puff pastry onto a lightly dusted work surface. Cut four circles from the pastry using a cookie cutter. Prick each pastry circle several times using a fork.",
        "In a bowl, mix together the chopped spinach, cheddar, nutmeg and ready-made ratatouille until well combined.",
        "Place two of the pastry circles onto the lined baking tray. Spoon half of the filling mixture into the centre of both pastry circles.",
        "Dab a little water around the edge of both pastry circles using a pastry brush. Place one of the remaining pastry circles over each, pressing down at the edges to seal.",
        "Sprinkle each pasty with a little water, then top with a little more grated cheddar.",
        "Bake the pasties in the oven for 12-15 minutes, or until the pastry has risen and is golden-brown. Set aside to cool slightly before eating with a tomato salad."
