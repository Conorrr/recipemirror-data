        "Preheat the oven to 180C/350F/Gas 4.",
        "Using a sharp knife, carefully score the mango flesh in a criss-cross pattern, being careful not to slice through the skin. Push the skin inside out to form the mango half into a 'hedgehog' shape.",
        "Place the mango half on a baking tray, drizzle over the honey, sprinkle with cinnamon and bake in the oven for about 2-3 minutes, or until beginning to caramelise.",
        "To serve, transfer the mango 'hedgehog' onto a serving plate and spoon some yoghurt alongside. Dust with icing sugar and garnish with a sprig of mint."
