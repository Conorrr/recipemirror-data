        "Add enough water to cover the fruit halfway up, then drop the cloves, cinnamon stick and bay leaf into the pan. Bring to a simmer, then cover the pan with a lid and reduce the heat. Cook for 6-7 minutes, until the plums have collapsed a little bit and the juices have mixed with the sugar.",
        "Serve the very cold ice cream in bowls, spoon over the hot plums and some of the cooking juices and serve immediately."
