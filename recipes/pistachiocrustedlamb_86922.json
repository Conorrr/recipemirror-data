        "Preheat the oven to 200C/400F/Gas 6.",

        "For the r\u00f6sti potato, heat the oil and butter in a small non-stick ovenproof frying pan. Season the grated potato well with salt and freshly ground black pepper, then press into the pan.",
        "Fry the potato on both sides until golden, then transfer to the oven for 6-8 minutes, or until the potato is tender.",
        "For the sauce, heat the butter and flour in a saucepan, stirring constantly, for 1-2 minutes.",
