        "Gradually add the beaten egg and stir until the mixture comes together as a soft dough. If the mixture becomes too sticky, add a little more flour.",

        "Bake the buns in the oven for 15-20 minutes, or until golden-brown on top and cooked through (a skewer inserted into the centre of each should come out clean). Set aside to cool, then eat with grapes, if desired."
