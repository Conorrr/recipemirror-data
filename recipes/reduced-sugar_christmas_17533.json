        "Preheat the oven to 120C/100C Fan/Gas \u00bd. Line a baking tray with parchment paper.",

        "Arrange 8 large spoonfuls of the mixture in a circle on the prepared tray in a ring to form a wreath. Bake for 30 minutes, then reduce the oven to 110C/90C Fan/Gas \u00bc and bake for another 1\u00bd hours.",
        "Turn off the oven, leave the door ajar and leave until the meringues are cold.",

        "Top the meringue with the yoghurt mixture and then scatter over the raspberries and almonds. Finely grate over the chocolate and serve."
