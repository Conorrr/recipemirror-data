        "Crush the reserved cherry stones with a hammer or rolling pin and wrap them in a muslin bag. Place all the ingredients apart from the seasonings in a pan with the bag of cherry stones, bring to a boil and simmer for 5-6 minutes.",
        "Remove the pan from the heat and set aside until just warm then remove the bag of cherry stones.",
        "Place the cherry mixture in a food processor and pulse until smooth. Pass the soup through a fine sieve into a bowl. Season with sea salt, freshly ground black pepper and lemon juice. The soup is best eaten just warm with a swirl of sour cream on top and a slice of walnut bread alongside."
