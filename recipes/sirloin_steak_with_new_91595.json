        "Put the oysters and their juice in a food processor with the mustard and blend until smooth. Gradually add the oil, blending as you go, until you achieve a mayonnaise consistency. Store in the fridge until you're ready to serve.",
        "Spoon a little bit of the dressing directly onto the steak. And then run the rest of the dressing through the salad. Place the steak on a serving plate, serve with the salad and tartare dressing and place the oyster mayonnaise next to it."
