    "description": "These little yoghurt jellies are sweetened with no-added-sugar cordial and will hit the spot if you are used to finishing a meal with dessert. The yoghurt brings extra protein and the jellies are topped with mixed berries for fibre. Leaf gelatine is very simple to use and easily available \u2013 so give it a go. With a GI of 39 this meal is high protein, low GI and provides 42 kcal per portion.",
