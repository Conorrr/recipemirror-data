        "In a large bowl, mix the turnips and swede with the juniper berries, cloves, mace, salt, sugar and cayenne. Cover and set aside for 3 hours for the vegetable juices to release and exchange flavours.",
        "In a large saut\u00e9 pan or frying pan over a high heat, sweeten the turnips and swede in the duck fat. Lower the heat to medium and cook for 5 minutes, stirring occasionally. The vegetables should be slightly soft but still have a little bite. Stir in the vinegar and gin, taste and season if required.",
        "Serve immediately or store in an airtight container in the fridge for up to two weeks."
