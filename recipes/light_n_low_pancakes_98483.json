        "Place the flour into a bowl. Beat the egg, milk and oil together, then slowly add to the flour. Stir the mixture until a smooth batter forms. Leave to stand for about 20 minutes, then stir again.",
        "Spray a nonstick frying pan with oil. When the oil is hot, add 2 tablespoons of the pancake mixture and shake the pan so that it spreads. Cook the pancake for 2 minutes, or until the underside is lightly browned. Turn over and cook the other side for a further minute.",
        "Keep the pancake warm while you cook the rest. The mixture should make 8 pancakes in all. Divide the pancakes between 4 plates, top the pancakes with the mixed berries and yoghurt and serve."
