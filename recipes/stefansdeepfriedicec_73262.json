        "The day before you wish to serve the deep-fried ice-cream, scoop balls of ice-cream onto a baking tray and place in the freezer.",
        "The next day, brush the melted butter over one square of filo and top with a second square. Brush the sides of the second square with butter before placing one ball of ice-cream inside. Carefully draw the sides of the filo up to form a little parcel. Return to the freezer.",
        "Preheat the oil in a deep-fat fryer or wok (CAUTION: Hot oil is very dangerous. Do not leave unattended). Remove the parcels from the freezer and drop into the hot oil. Fry for 30 seconds, then carefully remove using a slotted spoon. Pat with a piece of kitchen towel and serve."
