        "For the confit tomato preheat the oven to 90C/70C Fan/Gas \u00bc. Line a baking tray with parchment.",
        "Mix all the ingredients in a large bowl. Spread the mixture out on the lined baking tray and place in the oven for 2 hours, checking to make sure it doesn\u2019t dry out completely.",
        "For the chive oil, blend the chives and oil in a liquidiser until smooth.",
        "For the smoked haddock rarebit, season the haddock with salt and pepper and place in a hot frying pan with a little olive oil and cook for 5-6 minutes.",
        "In a separate pan, melt the butter and add the flour. Cook for a couple of minutes. Gradually add the milk, whisking constantly until you have a smooth white sauce.",
        "Whisk in the cheese and add the mustard, egg yolk, breadcrumbs and Worcestershire sauce and stir.",
        "Preheat the grill to high. Top the haddock with the rarebit mixture and place under the grill until golden-brown on top.",
        "To serve, remove the haddock from the grill and place in the centre of the plate and put the confit tomatoes around the edge, and season with salt and black pepper. Drizzle the chive oil over the top."
