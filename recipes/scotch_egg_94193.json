        "Boil four of the eggs in a pan of boiling water for five minutes and then drain the eggs and plunge into cold water to cool. Drain. Peel the shells off carefully as the inside will still be soft.",
        "Preheat the oven to 180C/350F/Gas 4.",
        "Slice open the sausages, remove the meat and mix it with the chopped apple in a bowl.",
        "Divide the mixture into four equal portions and flatten out into a patty using your hands.",
        "Crack the remaining egg into a bowl and beat with a pinch of salt, nutmeg and a little milk to create an egg wash.",
        "Gently mould each sausage patty around a soft boiled egg. Be careful not to squeeze it or the egg could burst.",
        "Trim any excess meat, but make sure you don\u2019t leave any gaps around the egg.",
        "Sprinkle the flour onto a plate and mix a pinch of salt in. Prepare a separate plate of breadcrumbs, Coat the sausage-covered eggs in the flour, dip it into the egg wash making sure it\u2019s covered and finally lay it into the breadcrumbs and shake to cover.",
        "Heat the oil in a deep-fat fryer or heavy-based saucepan to 180C/350F. (CAUTION: hot oil can be dangerous. Do not leave unattended.) Add the eggs, two at a time and fry for about 3-4 minutes.",
        "Once the Scotch eggs are golden-brown, remove with a slotted spoon and transfer to a baking tray and bake for 10 minutes."
