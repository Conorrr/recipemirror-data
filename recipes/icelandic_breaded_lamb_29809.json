        "For the red cabbage, melt the butter in a large saucepan and gently fry the onion until soft. Add the red cabbage and cook for 2 minutes. Add the apple, vinegar, blueberries, brown sugar, bramble jelly, cloves, cinnamon stick and 125ml/4fl oz water. Season with 20 turns of a black pepper mill and the salt. Cover with a tight-fitting lid and cook for 45 minutes, then check the liquid, if drying out add a splash more water; if there is a lot of liquid in the pan, remove the lid so any excess evaporates. Cook for another 15 minutes.",
        "For the lamb, season the chops with salt and pepper. Put the flour, beaten eggs and breadcrumbs in separate shallow bowls. Toss the chops in the flour, then dip in the beaten egg and coat with the breadcrumbs.",
        "Heat the butter and oil in a large frying pan. Once hot, fry the chops until golden-brown all over and cooked through (about 7\u20138 minutes on each side).",
        "To serve, remove the cinnamon stick and cloves from the cabbage. Serve the cabbage and chops with boiled new potatoes rolled in melted butter and sprinkled with chopped parsley."
