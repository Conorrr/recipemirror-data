        "Pour the jam liquid all over the bread. Using a slotted spoon or ladle, press the bread down to soak up all the juices.",

        "Meanwhile, slice the cherries and strawberries in half, and discard the cherry stones.",
        "Add the vanilla extract to the double cream in a large bowl and lightly whisk until soft peaks form when the whisk is removed from the bowl.",
