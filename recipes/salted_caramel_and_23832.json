        "For the choux pastry": [
            "50g/1\u00beoz unsalted butter, cut into roughly 1cm/\u00bdin pieces",
            "1 tsp caster sugar",
            "pinch salt",
            "65g/2\u00bcoz strong white bread flour",
            "2 medium free-range eggs, beaten"
        ],
        "For the coffee filling": [
            "200g/7oz mascarpone",
            "1 tbsp icing sugar",
            "3 tbsp cold strong coffee (espresso is ideal)",
            "250ml/9fl oz double cream"
        ],
        "For the salted caramel icing": [
            "150g/5\u00bdoz soft light brown sugar",
            "75g/2\u00bdoz soft, unsalted butter",
            "pinch salt",
            "50ml/2fl oz full-fat milk",
            "125g/4\u00bdoz icing sugar, sifted"
        ]

    "steps": [
        "Preheat your oven to 190C/375F/Gas 5. Line two baking trays with parchment.",
        "For the choux pastry, put the butter, sugar, salt and 150ml/5fl oz of water into a large saucepan. Heat gently until the butter has melted, then bring to the boil. Immediately remove from the heat and tip in the flour. Beat with a wooden spoon to form a smooth ball of dough that leaves the sides of the pan.",
        "Now vigorously beat the egg into the hot dough, a little at a time. This takes some elbow grease! As you add the egg, the dough will become stiff and glossy. Stop adding the egg if the dough starts to become loose \u2013 but you should use up all or most of it. Spoon the mixture into a piping bag fitted with a 1cm/\u00bdin plain nozzle. Pipe four sausage shapes, about 12cm/4\u00bdin long, on each baking tray, leaving plenty of space for them to spread during cooking.",
        "Bake for 30 minutes, or until well risen and golden-brown. Remove from the oven and split one side of each \u00e9clair to allow the steam to escape. Cool on a wire rack.",
        "To make the filling, beat the mascarpone in a bowl until smooth. Beat in the icing sugar and coffee. Whip the cream until it holds soft peaks when the whisk is removed. Fold the cream into the mascarpone mixture. Spoon the mixture into a piping bag fitted with a 1cm/\u00bdin plain nozzle and fill each \u00e9clair with the mix.",
        "To make the icing, put the sugar, butter and salt into a small saucepan. Gently heat until the butter has melted and the mixture is smooth. Add the milk, bring to the boil and boil for two minutes, stirring occasionally. Remove from the heat and sift in the icing sugar. Stir until smooth. Spread the icing on the \u00e9clairs. You\u2019ll need to work quickly before the icing sets but it can be reheated if it sets before you have finished.",
        "Serve the \u00e9clairs as soon as the icing is set."
