    "description": "The success of this dish is in carefully controlling the heat when cooking the fish. If the butter becomes too hot, it will burn, and the meat or fish will dry out, however if the butter is not hot enough, the fish or meat will not brown and will stew in its own juices.",

        "For the potatoes, in a pan of lightly salted boiling water simmer the potatoes for 7-10 minutes, or until tender. Drain and cut each potato in half. Dress the warm potatoes with the remaining ingredients. Season, to taste, with salt and freshly ground black pepper.",

        "To serve, place the fish on large oval serving plates and pour the sauce over and around the fish. Sprinkle the chopped parsley over the top and serve. Serve the dressed potatoes in a side bowl."
