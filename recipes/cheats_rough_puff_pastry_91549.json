        "Mix the flour and salt together in a bowl. Rub in the chilled butter using your fingertips until the mixture resembles breadcrumbs. Gradually add enough water to form a dough (about 4-6 tablespoons of water).",
        "Roll the dough out into a rectangle on a lightly floured work surface.",
        "Grate half of the frozen butter over the bottom two thirds of the dough. Fold down the top third and fold up the bottom third as if folding a letter.",
        "Turn the folded dough through 90 degrees and roll it out into a rectangle again. Repeat the process of adding the remaining frozen butter and fold as before.",
        "Wrap the dough in cling film and leave to rest in the fridge for 30 minutes before using."
