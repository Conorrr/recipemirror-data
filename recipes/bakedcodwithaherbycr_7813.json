        "Heat the oven to 200C/180C Fan/Gas 6.",
        "Mix together the herbs (if using), garlic and oil. Stir in the breadcrumbs and season with salt and pepper. Put the fish on a baking sheet and spread the breadcrumb mixture over the fish. Bake in the oven for 10-15 minutes until the flesh becomes opaque and flakes easily.",
        "Boil the potatoes in a large pan of water for 12-15 minutes, until cooked through. Boil the peas in a separate pan of water for a few minutes until just cooked. Take the cod out of the oven and serve with the potatoes and peas."
