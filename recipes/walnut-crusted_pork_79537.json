            "6 large thick-cut pork chops",
            "1 tsp ground cinnamon",
            "1 tsp freshly grated nutmeg",
            "100g/3\u00bdoz walnuts, finely chopped",
            "2 tbsp olive oil",
            "70g/2\u00bdoz butter, softened",
            "125ml/4fl oz white wine",
            "16 dried figs, finely chopped",
            "125ml/4fl oz chicken stock",
            "1 tbsp roughly chopped flatleaf parsley",
            "1 lemon, juice only",

        "Season the pork chops with salt and pepper and score the flesh with a sharp knife.",
        "In a shallow roasting tin, mix the cinnamon, nutmeg and walnuts. Add the olive oil to make a paste. Roll the chops in the nuts, pushing the crumb into the flesh.",
        "Melt 40g/1\u00bdoz of the butter in a large non-stick lidded frying pan and brown the chops two at a time, being careful not to burn the walnuts. This will take a few minutes each side.",
        "Return all the chops to the pan, cover with a lid and cook for 10 minutes over a medium heat, or until cooked through. Transfer the pork chops to a warmed plate and cover with foil to keep warm.",
        "Deglaze the pan with the white wine, continue to cook until the volume of the liquid has reduced by half. Add the chopped figs and chicken stock, season to taste. Whisk in the remaining butter, the parsley and lemon juice.",
        "Serve the pork chops with the sauce spooned over."
