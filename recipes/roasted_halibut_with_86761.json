        "Heat 50g/1\u00beoz of the butter in an ovenproof frying pan set over a medium to high heat. When the butter is foaming, add the fish and transfer to the oven for 6-8 minutes, or until cooked through.",
        "Heat another frying pan and add the remaining butter. When the butter is foaming, add the shallots and cook for a few minutes until softened.",
        "Once the butter is a nut-brown colour, add the capers, orange juice and parsley. Remove from the heat.",

        "To serve, place the asparagus in the centre of serving plates and top with the halibut. Drizzle the caper and butter sauce over and around the plate."
