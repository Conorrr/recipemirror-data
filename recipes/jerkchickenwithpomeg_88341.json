        "For the jerk chicken, using a sharp knife, make deep cuts into the chicken flesh and place into a bowl.",
        "Place the remaining jerk chicken ingredients into a food processor and blend to a pur\u00e9e. Pour the marinade over the chicken and turn to coat all the pieces. Place into the fridge for at least four hours, but preferably overnight.",
        "Preheat the oven to 200C/400F/Gas 6.",

        "For the rice, place the rice into a saucepan with 400ml/14fl oz of cold water. Cover with a lid and place over a high heat. Bring to the boil, then reduce the heat and simmer very gently until all of the water has been absorbed and the rice is tender (about 10-15 minutes). Turn off the heat and leave to steam for 5-6 minutes.",
        "Place the rice into a bowl and add all the remaining rice ingredients and mix well to combine. Season, to taste, with salt and freshly ground black pepper.",
        "To serve, spoon a little of the rice onto each plate and top with a piece of jerk chicken. Garnish with a couple of wedges of lime."
