        "Heat a heavy-based frying pan over a medium heat. Pour a little of the melted butter into the hot pan, add half the chicken livers and cook for three minutes. The livers should be cooked on the outside and pink in the middle. Transfer them to a plate and repeat with the rest of the livers.",

        "Transfer the p\u00e2t\u00e9 to eight small ramekins, cover with cling film and chill.",
        "When you are ready to serve, uncover the p\u00e2t\u00e9s and garnish with dried cranberries and fresh bay leaves to give them a festive feel. Serve with hot toast and spicy chutney."
