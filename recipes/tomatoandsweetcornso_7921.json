        "Sweat the garlic and onion in olive oil until soft and translucent. Add the cumin and cook for a minute or so before adding the tomatoes, sweetcorn, stock and tomato pur\u00e9e. Bring to the boil, then turn down the heat and allow to simmer for 15-20 minutes.",
        "The soup is good just as it is, rustic and chunky. If you prefer a smoother soup, just blend half of the mixture. Scatter with fresh herbs and serve with a drizzle of olive oil. Season well."
