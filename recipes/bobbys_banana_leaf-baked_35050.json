        "Preheat the oven to 200C/180C fan/Gas 6.",
        "For the spice paste, dry-fry the white pepper, black pepper, nutmeg, tailed pepper, cumin seeds, aniseed, long pepper and coriander seeds in a frying pan over a medium heat for 4-5 minutes, or until toasted and fragrant.",
        "Grind the toasted spices to a fine powder in a large pestle and mortar or spice grinder. Add the remaining spice paste ingredients and continue to pound the ingredients to a rough paste. Set aside.",
        "For the baked sea bass, rub the sea bass all over with the lime juice and set aside for 5 minutes.",
        "Spread the spice paste all over the fish until coated. Season with salt, then stuff the cavity with the lemon-basil leaves and bay leaves.",
        "Put the fish in the centre of the banana leaf (use several leaves if you cannot find one that's big enough). Fold the edges of the banana leaf over the fish to create a tight parcel. Secure with wooden skewers or cocktail sticks.",
        "Bake the sea bass in the oven for 40-50 minutes, or until the fish is cooked through. Unwrap the fish and remove the meat from the bones, keeping the skin as intact as possible. Serve with turmeric-cooked vegetables."
