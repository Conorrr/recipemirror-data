        "For the chilli paste, heat the oil in a medium saut\u00e9 pan. When hot add the chillies, onion and garlic and cook for 5-7 minutes. Leave to cool, then put in a blender and blend until smooth then set aside.",
        "Put the sweet potato in a large pan with the orange juice, sugar and 200ml/7fl oz water and bring to the boil. Add the cloves, cinnamon and star anise and cook over a high heat for 6-8 minutes, or until just tender. Drain and run under cold water. Discard the cloves, cinnamon and star anise. Put the sweet potatoes in a bowl and set aside.",
        "For the chilli tiger\u2019s milk, put the ginger, garlic, coriander and lime juice in a bowl. Stir and leave to infuse for 3 minutes. Strain the mixture through a sieve into another bowl. Add the salt and chilli paste made earlier, and mix.",
        "For the ceviche, wash the red onion and leave to soak in iced water for 5 minutes. Drain thoroughly, spread out on kitchen paper or a clean tea towel to remove any excess water and then put in the fridge until needed. This will reduce the strength of the onions and help to keep them crisp.",
        "Put the fish in a large bowl, add a good pinch of salt and mix together gently with a metal spoon. The salt will help open the fish\u2019s pores. Leave for 2 minutes and then pour over all of the chilli tiger\u2019s milk and combine gently. Leave the fish to \u2018cook\u2019 in this marinade for 2 minutes.",
        "Add the onions, coriander, chilli and sweet potato to the fish. Mix together gently and season to taste. Divide between serving bowls and serve immediately."
