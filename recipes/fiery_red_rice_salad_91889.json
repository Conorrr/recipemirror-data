        "Measure the rice in a jug, then place in a pan with double the volume of boiling water. Add the salt. Bring to the boil, then cover and reduce the heat to a low simmer and cook for 20-30 minutes, or until the grains are tender but still have a little bite.",
        "Meanwhile, coarsely grate the carrots (use the thick grating blade of a food processor if you have one) and thinly slice the spring onions. Tip into a bowl and add half of the chopped coriander.",
        "For the dressing, make the dressing by mixing all the ingredients together in a jam jar and shake.",
        "Drain the rice if necessary and add to the bowl with the vegetables. Add the dressing, taste and season with more salt and pepper if necessary. Serve with the remaining coriander scattered on top."
    ],
    "tips": [
        "Camargue rice from France, is a brownish red colour and has a nutty flavour, it takes about 20 mins to simmer but should still retain a little \u2018bite\u2019 when cooked. Add as little or as much red chilli as you like. Don\u2019t waste any leftover chilli, it can be frozen in a little plastic bag and is easy to chop from frozen."
