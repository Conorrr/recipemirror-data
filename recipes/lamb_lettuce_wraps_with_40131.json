    "steps": [
        "Using a meat mallet or a rolling pin, flatten each piece of lamb with a few hits. Add the meat to a mixing bowl with the soy sauce, honey, cinnamon, cumin and garlic. Using your hands, mix well so that the honey is spread evenly into the mixture. Cover with cling film and leave in the fridge to marinate for at least 2 hours, or overnight.",
        "For the peanut sauce, heat the coconut milk, peanut butter and honey in a saucepan over a medium-low heat. Bring to a gentle simmer, stirring constantly, until the peanut butter and honey dissolve into the coconut milk. Set aside until needed.",
        "Heat a large frying pan over a medium-high heat and drizzle in a little vegetable oil. Shaking off any excess marinade, fry the lamb a little at a time to ensure you don\u2019t overcrowd the pan.",
        "Meanwhile, gently reheat the peanut sauce until warm.",
        "Serve the meat on a platter with the lettuce leaves, peanuts and spring onions and the peanut sauce in a bowl. To assemble a wrap, take a lettuce leaf, place some lamb on top, drizzle with peanut sauce and top with nuts and spring onions. Roll up and enjoy."
