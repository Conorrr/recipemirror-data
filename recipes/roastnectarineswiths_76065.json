        "Bring the dough together using your hands, and on a floured surface roll out and cut into three circles.",
        "Heat a griddle pan until hot and griddle the scones for 4-5 minutes on each side or until golden brown and cooked through.",
        "For the nectarines, gently heat the butter, caster sugar and brown sugar in a pan until dissolved. Add the nectarine halves to the pan and then transfer to the oven and cook for 6-8 minutes.",
        "Remove from the oven and take out the nectarines from the caramel. Add the cream to the pan with a squeeze of lemon. Swirl the pan and heat gently for a few minutes.",
        "To serve, transfer the griddled scones to a serving plate. Arrange the nectarines on half and pour the nectarine sauce."
