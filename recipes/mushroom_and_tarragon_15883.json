        "Preheat the oven to 200C/400F/Gas 6.",
        "Roll the puff pastry out to a 3mm/\u215bin thickness and using a 15cm/6in cutter, cut out eight circles.",
        "Place four circles of puff pastry onto a baking tray and spoon some of the chilled mushroom mixture into the centre of each circle leaving a 2.5cm/1in border.",
        "Cover each pastry circle with the remaining pastry circles and crimp the edges with a fork. Brush all over with the beaten egg. Bake in the oven for 20 minutes.",
        "Meanwhile for the chutney, heat some oil in a frying pan over a medium heat and fry the onion and chilli for 4-5 minutes, or until softened.",
        "Add the sugar and vinegar and bring to boil for 10-15 minutes. Season with salt and freshly ground black pepper, then fold in the gherkins",
        "Serve the pastries with the chutney."
