        "Preheat the oven to 200C/400F/Gas 6. Line a baking tray with baking parchment",
        "On a lightly floured surface, roll out the pastry to 30cm/12in x 23cm/9in.",
        "Cut the pastry into four strips lengthways and then six across, leaving you with 24 rectangles of pastry.",
        "Crumble the Stilton into a bowl and crush with a fork.",
        "Put a heaped teaspoon of the cheese into the centre left of each rectangle, brush the edges with the egg wash.",
        "Fold the pastry over the cheese and crimp the edges to seal and place onto the lined baking tray.",
        "Brush the outside with the beaten egg and grate the parmesan over each parcel. Make a little hole in the top of each parcel with the tip of a sharp knife.",
        "Bake for 10-15 minutes until golden-brown all over."
