        "Preheat the oven to 150C/300F/Gas 2.",
        "Season the lamb shanks with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Heat a large ovenproof casserole until smoking, add the oil and lamb shanks and cook for 2-3 minutes on each side, or until golden-brown all over.",
        "Remove the lamb from the pan and set aside. Add the onions, carrots, swede and garlic to the pan and cook for 2-3 minutes, or until golden-brown.",
        "Add the rosemary, bay leaves, thyme and tomato pur\u00e9e to the pan and cook for a further minute, then stir in the pearl barley. Cover with the chicken stock and bring to a simmer.",
        "Cover the pan with a tight-fitting lid, then transfer to the oven to cook for at least three hours, or preferably 5-6 hours, until the lamb is very tender. (You may need to add a bit more liquid.)",
        "Remove the pan from the oven and stir in the mint jelly and parsley. Season, to taste, with salt and freshly ground black pepper and serve."
