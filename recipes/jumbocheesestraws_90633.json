        "Preheat the oven to 200C/400F/Gas 6.",
        "On a lightly floured work surface, roll out the puff pastry to a thin sheet.",

        "Fold the pastry over the ham and gorgonzola, then roll out again to a thin sheet.",
        "Trim the edges of the filled pastry, brush all over with the beaten egg and sprinkle over the celery seeds.",
        "Cut the filled pastry into 1cm/\u00bdin strips.",
        "Twist the strips and transfer each to a baking tray. Press the ends of the pastry twists down to secure them to the tray and prevent them from unravelling.",
        "Bake in the oven for 20-25 minutes, or until golden-brown. Set aside to cool slightly, then serve."
