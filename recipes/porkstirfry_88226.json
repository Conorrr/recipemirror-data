        "Preheat the oven to 180C/350F/Gas 4.",
        "Cut the pork into two medallions and season with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Heat the vegetable oil in an ovenproof frying pan and sear the pork on all sides. Place the pan in the oven for about 5-7 minutes, or until completely cooked through.",
        "Cut one of the spring onions into thin slices and cut the other into thin strips (julienne). Heat the sesame oil in a wok and stir fry the spring onion strips until crisp. Set aside to use for the garnish.",
        "Add the red pepper and sliced spring onion and stir-fry for 1-2 minutes, then add the nuts. Once everything has begun to take on some colour, add the soy sauce.",
        "In a bowl, blend the coconut milk, coriander, sage and parsley with a hand-held blender. Add to the wok and stir to coat the ingredients.",
        "To serve, place the cooked noodles onto a serving plate and spoon the stir-fried vegetables on top. Top with the medallions of pork and garnish with the fried spring onion and chopped coriander."
