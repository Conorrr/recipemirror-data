    "steps": [
        "For the pastry, preheat the oven to 180C/350F/Gas 4.",
        "In a large bowl, rub the butter and flour together to a breadcrumb texture using your fingers. Add the egg and salt to bring the pastry together. Wrap in cling film and chill in the fridge for 10 minutes.",
        "Remove the pastry from the fridge, and roll out to fit a deep 18cm/7in loose-bottomed tart tin. Place the pastry-lined tin in the fridge for 10 minutes to firm up.",
        "Place a piece of greaseproof paper into the tart shell and fill with baking beans or dried pulses. Bake for 10 -15 minutes and then remove greaseproof and beans. Leave in oven for a further 10 minutes so that the pastry is dry and crisp.",
        "For the filling, in a frying pan fry the bacon, garlic and onion together in the butter until softened and golden-brown. Drain off any excess fat.",
        "Mix the cream and eggs together in a bowl until well combined.",
        "Layer the cheese with the bacon and onion mixture in the cooked pastry case and pour over the egg mixture. Top with some more cheese and trim the crust if needed.",
        "Bake for 25-30 minutes or until the filling is just set in the middle. Serve in slices while still hot."
