        "Prick the chicken all over and make a few slits about 2cm/\u00bein long on the skin.",
        "Mix all the remaining chicken ingredients into a smooth paste and rub the marinade generously all over the chicken skin. Cover and refrigerate for eight hours or overnight.",
        "Preheat the oven to 180C/350F/Gas 4.",
        "Place the chicken in a roasting tin and cover with foil. Roast in the centre of the oven for 1\u00bd hours. Halfway through cooking, baste with a little of the marinade.",
        "Remove chicken from the oven and leave in a warm place to rest for 20 minutes.",
        "Meanwhile, for the coriander chutney, place all the ingredients in a blender and blend until the mixture become a coarse paste. Add 4-5 tablespoons of cold water to ease blending. Alternatively, use a pestle and mortar. This chutney can be stored in an airtight, non-metallic container for up to four days in the refrigerator."
