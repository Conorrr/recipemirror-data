    "steps": [
        "Place the salmon in a fish kettle. If you haven't got one a large roasting tin will do fine.",
        "Add enough cold water to cover the fish (it must be covered). Add the onion, bay leaves, vinegar and lemon and a good pinch of salt and a little black pepper.",
        "Cover with a lid, or tin foil, and bring to the boil on the stove. It is easier and quicker to put two rings on underneath the fish. Once it is boiling, turn off the heat and allow the fish to stand in the water until cool.",
        "Carefully remove the salmon and place onto a board. Carefully scrape off the skin and place on a large flat serving dish. Serve with a bowl of lemon wedges and a bowl of hollandaise."
