        "default": [
            "1.5kg/3lb 5oz King Edward or Maris Piper potatoes",
            "1 sprig rosemary",
            "1 sprig thyme",
            "5-6 garlic cloves, roughly bashed",
            "1 bay leaf",
            "\u00bd tbsp whole black peppercorns",
            "6 tbsp goose fat",
            "sea salt"

    "steps": [
        "Peel and halve the potatoes (quarter any large ones; the pieces should all be around the same size). Put the potatoes into a large saucepan along with the rosemary, garlic, bay and peppercorns. Cover with cold water and bring to the boil. Reduce the heat slightly and simmer for 5-7 minutes.",
        "Drain the potatoes and leave in the colander to steam dry for 5-10 minutes.",
        "Meanwhile preheat the oven to 220C/425F/Gas 7. Put the goose fat into a large roasting tin and put in the oven for 3-5 minutes, or until very hot.",
        "Carefully tip the potatoes (as well as the aromatics they were boiled with) into the hot goose fat, shake gently to move around and roast for 35-40 minutes, turning once or twice.",
        "After 20 minutes in the oven remove and gently squash the potatoes a little to create more surface area to make them extra crisp. Return to the oven and cook for a further 15-20 minutes, or until crisp and golden-brown.",
        "Discard the aromatics and then season the potatoes with salt. Serve."
