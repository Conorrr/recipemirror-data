        "Carefully remove the skin from both sides of the trout and sprinkle over the brioche crumbs.",
        "Place the pan in the oven and bake for another 2-3 minutes or until the fish is cooked through.",

        "Drain the beans and combine in a bowl with the Little Gem lettuce leaves.",
        "For the beurre noisette, heat a frying pan until hot, add the butter and cook until it turns a nut-brown colour.",
        "Add the lemon juice, capers, toasted almonds and a pinch of salt and freshly ground black pepper and then remove from the heat.",
        "To serve, place the beans and Little Gem lettuce onto the plate. Top with the trout then spoon the beurre noisette around."
