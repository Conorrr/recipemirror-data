    "steps": [
        "Toast the slices of bread on both sides until pale brown.",
        "Rub one side of each slice of toast with the cut side of a clove of garlic, using a new half garlic every couple of slices.",
        "Rub the garlicky side of each slice with the cut side of a tomato. The aim is to give the bread a red colour and tomato flavour without making it too soggy. Use a new tomato half every two or three slices, as you need to.",
        "Arrange the slices on a serving plate, drizzle with the olive oil and sprinkle with salt to serve."
