        "default": [
            "1 loaf sourdough bread (or any crusty dense white bread), sliced into 6-8 thick slices",
            "3-4 garlic cloves, halved",
            "2\u20133 tomatoes, preferably organic, halved",
            "2 tbsp extra virgin olive oil",

    },
    "steps": [
        "Toast the slices of bread on both sides until pale brown.",
        "Rub one side of each slice of toast with the cut side of a clove of garlic, using a new half garlic every couple of slices.",
        "Rub the garlicky side of each slice with the cut side of a tomato. The aim is to give the bread a red colour and tomato flavour without making it too soggy. Use a new tomato half every two or three slices, as you need to.",
        "Arrange the slices on a serving plate, drizzle with the olive oil and sprinkle with salt to serve."
