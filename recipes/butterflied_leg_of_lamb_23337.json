    "description": "This dish is a great for feeding a crowd. It is super simple to make and full of flavour. You can buy a butterflied joint from your butcher. A \u2018butterflied\u2019 joint is where the bone has been removed and the meat opened out into roughly the shape of a butterfly. This means it is quicker to cook and easier to carve.",

        "Preserved lemons are whole lemons that have been preserved by being packed into tall jars with salt, herbs and spices, then covered with lemon juice or brine and left to cure for a few weeks. They are used a lot in North African cooking, including tagines. It\u2019s best not to use too many, however, or they can overpower a dish."
