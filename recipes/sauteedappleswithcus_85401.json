        "For the saut\u00e9ed apples, heat the butter in a small frying pan and gently cook the apple pieces for 4-5 minutes, or until beginning to turn golden-brown.",
        "Add the raisins and cinnamon and cook for a further 3-4 minutes, until the apples are softened and caramelised. Squeeze in the lemon juice and stir to combine.",
        "For the custard, place the milk and cream into a saucepan and bring up to the boil. Remove from the heat and allow to cool slightly.",
        "Place the egg and egg yolk and the sugar into a bowl and mix well. Gradually pour the milk and cream over the egg mixture, then return the mixture to the pan over a gentle heat. Stir constantly until the custard starts to thicken. When it coats the back of a spoon, remove from the heat and pour through a sieve into a jug or bowl.",
        "To serve, place the apples onto a plate and drizzle over the custard."
