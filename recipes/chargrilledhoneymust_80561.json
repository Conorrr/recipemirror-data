        "Preheat the oven to 200C/400F/Gas 6.",
        "Place the honey, mustard and pineapple juice into a bowl and mix together well, then add the gammon and leave to marinate for a few minutes.",
        "Meanwhile, for the chutney place all of the ingredients into a saucepan over a medium heat. Bring to the boil then reduce the heat to simmer for 10-15 minutes, stirring occasionally.",
        "To finish the gammon, heat an ovenproof griddle pan until smoking and add the gammon. Griddle for two minutes on each side, to brown, and then transfer to the oven to cook for 5-10 minutes, or until cooked through.",
        "To serve, slice the gammon into four even pieces, place on a plate and top with the chutney."
