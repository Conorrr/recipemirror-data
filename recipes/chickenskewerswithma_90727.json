        "Soak two wooden skewers in cold water for 10-15 minutes, then drain and set aside.",
        "For the skewers, mix the chilli powder, ground turmeric and curry powder together in a bowl with the cream until well combined.",
        "Thread the chicken strips onto the skewers, alternating the chicken with the green pepper, then rub with the creamy spice mixture.",
        "Heat a chargrill pan until smoking and griddle the skewers for 2-3 minutes on both sides, or until golden-brown and the chicken is cooked through. (The chicken is cooked through when the juices run clear when pierced in the thickest part with a skewer.)",
        "For the salsa, combine all of the salsa ingredients together in a small bowl.",
        "Serve the chicken skewers alongside a bowl of the salsa for dipping."
