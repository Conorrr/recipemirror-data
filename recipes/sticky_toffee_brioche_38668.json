        "For the toffee sauce, melt the sugar in a pan over a medium heat and cook until it goes a caramel brown.",
        "Stir in the butter and cream (it will bubble furiously, so be careful as you stir) and stir continuously until smooth and completely incorporated.",
        "Coat the bottom of a greaseproof dish with a third of the caramel sauce.",
        "Top with a layer of the brioche slices and then pour over a third of the custard ensuring it fully coats all the brioche pieces. Repeat the process until you have three layers.",
        "Bake in the oven for one and a half hours or until golden-brown and set.",
        "Serve the pudding with a good-quality ice cream."
