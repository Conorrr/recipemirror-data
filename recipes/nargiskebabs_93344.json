            "5 free-range eggs, plus 1 egg yolk",

            "2 garlic cloves, peeled, crushed",
            "2.5cm/1in piece root ginger, peeled, grated",
            "\u00bd tsp ground coriander",
            "\u00bd tsp ground cumin",
            "\u00bd tsp chilli powder",

    "steps": [
        "Bring a large pan of water to the boil and cook 4 of the eggs for 4-5 minutes until they are medium- to hard-boiled. Drain and cool under cold running water (this will prevent the yolks from discolouring). Peel and set aside. Beat the remaining egg in a bowl and set aside.",
        "In a bowl, mix together the minced beef, garlic, ginger, spices, cornflour and egg yolk until well combined. Season, to taste, with salt.",
        "Divide the beef mixture evenly into 4 portions. Roll each portion into a ball, then flatten out to form a thin patty. Wrap each patty around the peeled boiled eggs, smoothing out the join and making sure there is no egg left exposed.",
        "Roll the scotch eggs in the flour, then dip in the beaten egg and roll in the sesame seeds.",
        "Half-fill a frying pan with the vegetable oil and heat until hot. (CAUTION: hot oil can be dangerous. Do not leave unattended). Fry the nargis kebabs in small batches for 4-5 minutes, turning the eggs occasionally, or until golden-brown all over and cooked through. Remove from the oil with a slotted spoon and drain on kitchen paper."
