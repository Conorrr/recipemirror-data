        "For the Stilton butter, mix the butter, crumbled Stilton and salt and freshly ground black pepper together in a bowl.",

        "To serve, place a griddled baguette half onto a plate. Top with the caramelised onions, then the steak and finally with the Stilton butter. Place the other half of the griddled baguette on top. Serve with lashings of tomato ketchup and the skinny fries alongside."
