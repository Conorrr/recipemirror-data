    "description": "This is an ideal chicken dish for an outdoor summer party. I favour cooking it in the oven because the marinade is apt to burn on a barbecue. Sumac is Turkey\u2019s favourite spice. It\u2019s a red berry with an astringent, lemony flavour, the fruit of a small bush. This dish is ideal as part of a warm and cold buffet where people have a bit of everything including a rice pilaf.",
