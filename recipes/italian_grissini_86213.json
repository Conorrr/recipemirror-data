        "Gradually add the remaining flour, salt, cheeses, Italian seasoning, garlic powder and the chopped jalape\u00f1os until completely incorporated.",
        "Turn the dough out onto a lightly oiled surface and knead for about 5-8 minutes.",

        "Roll out the dough until at least 28cm/11in long. Brush with the egg yolk, sprinkle over the rub and gently press it in so that it sticks. Using either a knife or a pizza cutter, cut out strips of the dough, and holding from either ends of the strip, twist the dough gently and quickly to create a spiral and place onto a baking tray straightaway.",
        "Bake for 15-20 minutes, or until the breadsticks are lightly golden-brown and feel firm to the touch. Remove the breadsticks from the oven and leave to cool on the baking trays."
