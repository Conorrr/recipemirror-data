        "For the red fruit and wine soup, pour the wine, sugar and vanilla pod into a small saucepan. Bring to the boil, then reduce the heat and simmer until the sugar has dissolved and wine has reduced by half. Remove from the heat, remove the vanilla pod (it can be used again in another dish) and allow to cool slightly.",
        "For the vanilla cream, place the whipped cream into a bowl, add the vanilla seeds and gently stir.",
        "To serve, place the berries into the base of a shallow dessert bowl and scatter over the chopped mint. Pour over the red wine sauce and top with a dollop of vanilla cream."
