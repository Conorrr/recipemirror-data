        "Cut 4 pieces of nonstick baking paper, each 30cm/12in square. Put a haddock fillet in the centre of each piece and arrange some of the coriander, chilli, shallot, lime and chopped lemongrass stalk evenly over each. Wrap them up into neat parcels. Transfer the parcels to a baking sheet and bake for 20 minutes.",
