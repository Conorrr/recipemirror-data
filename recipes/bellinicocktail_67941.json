        "Place the peaches in a small blender and pur\u00e9e until totally smooth. This can be done well in advance and kept in the fridge. Spoon half into the chilled champagne glasses and slowly top up with champagne, stirring as you pour. You should ideally have one third peach pur\u00e9e to two thirds champagne. Serve straight away as a pre-dinner drink with the Cupid's Caviar, leaving plenty of time for a second glass each."
