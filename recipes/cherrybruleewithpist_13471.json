        "For the cr\u00e8me brulee, take the stones out of the cherries. Place in a pan with 100ml/3\u00bdfl oz water and bring to the boil, cook for 5 minutes. Chop roughly and place in the bottom of brulee dishes. Place the dishes in a bain marie (ie a water bath. You can use a deep roasting tin half filled with water.)",

        "For the pistachio biscuits, melt the butter and mix in the icing sugar. Lightly whisk the egg white and add the flour. Add the pistachios to the melted butter mixture and mix to a smooth paste. Leave to chill for 1 hour.",
        "Cut into biscuit shapes, rest for 10 minutes. Put on a tray and cook at 180C/350F/Gas 4 for 5 to 10 minutes.",
        "Take out of the oven and allow to cool.",
