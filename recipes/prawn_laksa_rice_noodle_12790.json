        "Put the ingredients for the laksa paste into a blender or food processor and process to a fine smooth paste.",

Season the soup with lime juice, (or salt and dried chilli flakes if preferred), add the beansprouts and spring onion. Remove the kaffir lime leaves, give it a final stir and then it is ready to serve.",
        "Divide the noodles evenly among the bowls and ladle over the soup. Garnish with the fried prawns, coriander leaves, and extra lime wedges."
