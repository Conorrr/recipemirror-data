    "description": "Norwegians love their bread and loaves made with rye flour are particularly popular. This wonderful bread tastes a bit like sourdough \u2013 only better. We like it made with a mixture of white flour and rye so it isn\u2019t too heavy, but you can change the proportions if you prefer a darker loaf \u2013 you may need to add extra water if using more rye. We cooked this by the side of a fjord after a trip on a longship, and we ate it with codfish (klippfisk) soup.",

        "default": [
            "175ml full-fat milk",
            "175ml water",
            "2 tbsp dark soft brown sugar",
            "1 x 7g sachet of fast-action dried yeast",
            "250g rye flour",
            "200g strong white flour, plus extra for dusting",
            "1 tbsp fine sea salt",
            "2 tsp caraway seeds",
            "sunflower oil, for greasing"

    "steps": [
        "Put the milk, water and sugar in a small saucepan and heat very gently, stirring constantly, for just a few seconds until the liquid is lukewarm and the sugar has dissolved. Remove the pan from the heat and pour the mixture into a bowl.",
        "Stir in the yeast and leave for 10 minutes until there is a light froth floating on the surface.",
        "Put all the flour, rye and white, in a large bowl, stir in the salt and caraway seeds, then make a well in the centre. Pour the warm yeast mixture on to the flour and mix with a wooden spoon and then your hands to form a soft, spongy dough.",
        "Turn the dough out on to a well-floured surface and knead for 10 minutes or until it is smooth and elastic. Kneading this dough can be hard work so you\u2019ll need to roll up your sleeves and give it some welly.",
        "Put the dough in a large, lightly oiled bowl and cover loosely with oiled cling film. Leave to rise in a warm place for about 1\u00bd hours or until it has doubled in size.",
        "Put the dough on a floured work surface and knock it back with your knuckles, then knead for another minute.",
        "Shape the dough into a fat oval or round loaf, pulling the dough from the top and sides and tucking it underneath to make a neat shape.",
        "Place the loaf on a baking tray lined with baking parchment and score the surface 4 times with a sharp knife. Cover it loosely with the oiled cling film and leave to prove for a further 40\u201350 minutes until it has doubled in size once more.",
        "Preheat the oven to 180C/350F/Gas 4. Bake the loaf in the centre of the oven for 40 minutes or until it is well risen and the base sounds hollow when tapped sharply. Cool for at least 20 minutes before serving."
