        "Preheat the oven to 150C/300F/Gas 2.",
        "For the beetroot, top, tail and wash the beetroot. Rub with oil, season with salt and pepper, to taste, wrap it in foil and bake until tender \u2013 this will take about two and a half hours. Leave to cool and then push the skin off with your fingers (use rubber gloves if you don\u2019t want purple hands). Cut into wedges and set aside.",
        "Put the balsamic vinegar, wine and sugar into a pan. Boil until the volume of liquid has reduced by half. Add the beetroot, season with salt, pepper and the butter, and keep warm.",
        "For the potatoes, peel the potatoes and boil them in a pan of boiling salted water until tender. Drain well.",
        "Put the smoked garlic bulb in a saucepan and cover with melted butter. Cook over a low heat for 45 minutes and then allow to cool. Peel the cloves and place back into the butter and then blend until smooth using a hand-blender.",
        "Crush the potatoes lightly with a folk. Mix in the garlic butter pur\u00e9e and season with salt and pepper, taking care not to turn the potatoes into mash.",
        "For the horseradish cream, lightly whip the double cream in a mixing bowl and then stir in the cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche, English mustard, fresh horseradish and lemon juice. Mix well and season to taste with salt and pepper. Set aside.",
        "For the beans, blanch the beans in a pan of boiling salted water for two minutes, then drain and refresh in a bowl of ice cold water. Drain again.",
        "Heat the butter in a frying pan and add the beans. Season with salt and pepper and fry for one minute to warm through. Set aside.",
        "For the steak, preheat a griddle to hot. Season the steak generously with salt and pepper, drizzle with a little olive oil and then place on the hot griddle. Cook for about two minutes on each side for rare, 3\u00bd for medium and then allow to rest for a minute before serving.",
        "To serve, place a scoop of potato on each plate along with the steak, surround with 3-4 wedges of beetroot and a little syrup, some beans and a neat spoonful of the horseradish cream."
