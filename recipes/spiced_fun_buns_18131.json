        "Wash your hands and put an apron on. Weigh or measure all the ingredients. Ask a grown-up to preheat the oven to 200C/400F/Gas 6. Put some baking paper on a baking tray.",
        "In a mixing bowl, stir together the currants, chopped peel and sugar.",
        "In another bowl, combine the flour with the mixed spice and butter. Rub the butter into the flour and spice until the mixture looks like fine breadcrumbs.",
        "Add the sugar, fruit and peel to the flour bowl and mix with a fork- just a few gentle stirs.",
        "Break the egg into a cup and beat with a fork then add some (but not all) to your fruity mixture. The mixture should be firm enough to shape but not dry. Add a bit more egg if it is too dry to shape.",
        "Using your hands, tear the mixture in half, then in half again then each piece in half until you have eight pieces. Leaving them in rough chunks, place them onto the baking tray. Ask a grown-up to put them in the oven to bake for 15-20 minutes. Serve the buns with some fresh fruit."
