    "steps": [
        "For the belly of pork, preheat the oven to 150C/300F/Gas 2.",
        "Place the pork belly in a deep roasting tin and pour over the chicken stock \u2013 it should come about half-way up the pork belly.",
        "Scatter over the spices, cover the tin with aluminium foil and cook in the oven for 2-4 hours, or until very tender.",
        "Remove from the oven, drain off the liquid and let the meat cool completely.",
        "For the blueberry molasses, place the blueberries and water in a food processor or blender and blend to a pur\u00e9e.",
        "Place the pur\u00e9e in a saucepan and add the sugar, lemon and chilli flakes. Bring to a boil and simmer for 40-60 minutes, or until the mixture becomes thick and syrupy. Season with salt and freshly ground black pepper, adding more chilli if you like a little more spice.",
        "Preheat the oven to 240C/475F/Gas 9. Remove the thick layer of skin and fat from the pork belly and discard. Place the pork in a clean roasting tin and glaze the top and side of the meat with the blueberry molasses.",
        "Place the pork in the oven for 5-6 minutes, or until the top is caramelised and slightly crisp.",
        "For the salad, whip the feta, yoghurt and ground cumin together in a bowl. Season with salt and freshly ground black pepper then place in a clean bowl with the salad leaves. Mix well, then sprinkle with the cumin and sesame seeds.",
        "Cut the pork into squares and serve with the salad."
