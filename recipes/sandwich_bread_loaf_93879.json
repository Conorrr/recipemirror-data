    "steps": [
        "Stir the golden syrup and melted butter into the warm milk until well combined. Crumble the yeast into a large bowl, then pour over the warm milk and stir until the yeast has dissolved.",
        "Add the remaining ingredients and mix until a smooth dough forms. Cover the bowl with cling film and set aside for 5 minutes.",
        "Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured work surface and knead for 10 minutes, or until smooth and elastic. Return the dough to the bowl, cover with cling film and place into a warm place for 1 hour, or until the dough has nearly doubled in size.",
        "Meanwhile, grease and flour a 12cm x 20cm/5in x 8in bread tin.",
        "Turn the dough out onto a floured work surface again and knock back a few times. Divide equally into two pieces and shape into balls. Place the dough balls side by side in the prepared bread tin, cover with cling film and set aside to rise again, until doubled in size.",
        "Preheat the oven to 220C/410F/Gas 7.",
        "Using a sharp knife, slash the dough a few times and place into the oven immediately. After 10 minutes, reduce the heat to 180C/350F/Gas 4 and bake for a further 30 minutes, or until the bread is golden-brown. To check if the bread is done, remove from the tin and tap the bottom with your knuckles \u2013 it should sound hollow.",
        "Leave the bread loaf to cool on a wire rack."

    "tips": [
        "The bread in this recipe is baked in loaf tins, but you could also shape the dough into little individual buns. The recipe is made with white flour but also works well with a mix of brown, rye or wholemeal flour, but the end result will be a little heavier. You could also mix in a few sultanas and cumin seeds, and serve slices with cheese."
