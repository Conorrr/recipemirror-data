            "175g/6oz unsalted butter, softened",
            "450g/1lb chicken livers, trimmed and cleaned",
            "2 shallots, finely chopped",
            "1 tsp soft thyme leaves",
            "2 cloves garlic, finely chopped",
            "2 tbsp brandy",
            "2 tsp anchovy essence",
            "\u00bd tsp freshly ground black pepper",
            "55g/2oz clarified butter, melted"

    "steps": [
        "Heat 15g/\u00bdoz of the butter in a frying pan until foaming.",
        "Add half the livers and fry for 7-8 minutes, or until golden-brown and cooked through. Repeat with a second batch of butter and livers.",
        "Place the livers and juices in a food processor.",
        "In the same pan heat another 15g/\u00bdoz butter, add the shallot, thyme and garlic, and cook over a moderate heat until the shallot is soft but not coloured.",
        "Add the brandy, anchovy essence and pepper, and scrape the bottom of the pan to release any coagulated juices.",
        "Place everything in the food processor, including the remaining unsalted butter. Blend until smooth.",
        "If you want a very smooth p\u00e2t\u00e9, pass the mixture through a fine sieve and put in a bowl. Cover with the cling film, cool then refrigerate. If not using within 48 hours, cover the top with clarified butter."
