        "For the madeleines, preheat the oven to 170C/325F/Gas 5 and butter the madeline tins.",

        "Spoon the batter into the tins, only half filling each indent.",
        "Bake for 12-15 minutes or until golden-brown. (Depending on the size of the madeleines, small ones may take only 8-10 minutes.)",
        "Mix the ground cinnamon and sugar for dusting on a plate, then roll the madeleines quickly in the sugar to coat them thoroughly.",
        "For the winter caramel sauce, heat the sugar in a pan until it turns a light golden-brown. Pour in half the cream and bring to the boil, stirring well.",
        "Add the star anise, cinnamon, reserved vanilla pod and butter and the rest of the cream. Cook for 2-3 minutes until thickened and smooth.",
        "Strain through a fine sieve into a serving bowl.",
        "Serve the madeleines with the sauce. They can be kept in an airtight container for up to a week."
