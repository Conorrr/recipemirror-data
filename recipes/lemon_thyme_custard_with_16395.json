        "For the lemon thyme custard, place the milk and cream in a large saucepan and add the lemon thyme. Heat for a couple of minutes. Meanwhile place the egg yolks and sugar in a large bowl and whisk.",
        "Sieve the milk and cream to get rid of the thyme. Gradually pour the liquid over the egg and sugar and keep whisking to stop the eggs from scrambling.",
        "Pour the mixture back into the saucepan and cook until it coats the back of the spoon.",
        "Allow the custard to cool. Once cool, add the whipped cream and mix it in.",
        "For the sweet scraps, heat the oil in a deep fat fryer to 170C/340F, or heat the oil in a deep, heavy-based pan until a breadcrumb sizzles and goes brown when dropped in. (Caution: Hot oil can be dangerous. Do not leave unattended.)",
        "Place the egg white, flour and bicarbonate of soda in a large bowl and whisk. Gradually add the sparkling water, whisking all the time.",
        "Drizzle the batter into the deep fat fryer and cook for 1-2 minutes to make scraps. Remove with a slotted spoon, drain on a plate lined with kitchen paper and dust with icing sugar.",
        "To serve, layer the lemon thyme custard and fresh raspberries in a serving glass. Garnish with the sweet scraps and a few more raspberries."
