    "description": "This rustic lamb casserole is full of flavour, especially if made ahead, and the lamb is meltingly tender. Harissa is a chilli paste with quite a kick; rose harissa, which I prefer to use, is sweeter and less fiery due to the addition of rose petals. I don\u2019t like my food too spicy, so this dish is mild, but if you prefer it hot just add more harissa and good luck!",

    "tips": [
        "The inclusion of the beans means you only need to serve with a green vegetable. If you omit the beans, serve with rice or couscous. If you need to spin the lamb out for extra-hungry people, add another can of beans to make the casserole go a little further. Prepare ahead: make up to 2 days ahead as the flavours will continue to develop. This dish freezes well."
