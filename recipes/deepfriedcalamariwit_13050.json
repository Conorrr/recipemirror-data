        "For the calamari, open up the squid tubes and slice into 2cm/\u00bein strips.",
        "Coat with flour and season.",
        "Place in the fridge for 2 hours. By doing this you'll find the flour will melt onto the squid creating a form of self-batter. When fried it will be deliciously crisp. It is not a traditional method, but an excellent alternative.",
        "Deep fry in hot oil until golden brown, drain on kitchen towel and serve with lemon mayonnaise.",
        "For the lemon mayonnaise, mix all ingredients together and serve with the calamari."
