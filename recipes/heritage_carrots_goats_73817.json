        "For the pickled carrots, put the vinegar, sugar, tarragon, coriander seeds and star anise in a medium saucepan with 50ml/2fl oz water and heat until the sugar has melted.",
        "Heat a large saucepan of boiling water and blanch the yellow carrots until cooked but still with a little crunch. Place in iced water, drain, then put them into the pickling solution.",
        "For the oats and hazelnuts, preheat the oven to 150C/300F/Gas 2.",
        "Spread the oats and chopped hazelnuts out on a large baking tray and drizzle over the grape seed oil. Roast for 10-15 minutes, or until golden-brown, then set aside.",
        "Increase the oven temperature to 170C/340F/Gas 3\u00bd.",
        "Place the orange carrots on a separate baking tray, drizzle with the oil and sprinkle over the salt and thyme. Roast for 20-25 minutes.",
        "Meanwhile, heat the carrot juice in a pan until reduced in volume to a sticky consistency.",
        "Heat the butter and cream in a separate large saucepan and whisk continually. Reduce it in volume and cook until it turns a toffee brown colour. Add it to the reduced carrot juice.",
        "Drain the pickled carrots from the pickling liquid.",
        "Serve the goat\u2019s curd, pickled carrots, roasted carrots, oats, nuts, carrot leaves and nasturtium leaves dressed with the carrot juice and garnished with the grated hazelnuts."
