        "To make the paste, place the coriander seeds, cloves, cinnamon and cumin seeds into a small frying pan and cook for 1-2 minutes or until the spices start to release their oils. In a spice grinder or pestle and mortar blend the toasted spices, shrimp paste and a tablespoon of cold water until smooth (you may need to add a little more water). Add the remaining ingredients, one at a time, blending well after each addition until the mixture forms a thick paste.",
        "Preheat the oven to 160C/140C Fan/Gas 3.",
        "Place a large, flameproof casserole over a medium-high heat. If the solid coconut cream has risen to the top of the tin, use this, or else pour in 125ml/4fl oz coconut milk and cook, stirring constantly for 3-5 minutes, until it separates. (If it does not separate, add the optional olive oil). Add 60g/2\u00bcoz of the curry paste and fry, stirring constantly, until fragrant, about 1-2 minutes.",
        "Add the venison and fry for 2-3 minutes until browned all over. Add the remaining coconut milk, reserving 2 tablespoons for the garnish. Increase the heat and bring to the boil. Add the palm sugar, fish sauce, tamarind pur\u00e9e, bay leaves and cardamom and return to the boil. Add 100ml/3\u00bdfl oz water to almost cover the venison and keep it moist.",
        "Cook in the oven for an hour or until the venison is nearly tender. Add the sweet potato, cover and return to the oven for a further hour, or until the potato is tender.",
        "Serve the curry with steamed rice topped with the chopped roasted peanuts and the coriander."
