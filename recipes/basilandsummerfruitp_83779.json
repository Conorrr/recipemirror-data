        "For the pudding": [
            "300g/11oz mixed frozen fruits, defrosted",
            "1 punnet mixed fresh berries: strawberries, blackberries and raspberries, (strawberries trimmed and cut into quarters)",
            "50g/2oz caster sugar",
            "10 fresh basil leaves, roughly chopped",
            "14 thin slices white bread"
        ],
        "For the basil syrup": [
            "200g/7oz caster sugar",
            "110ml/4fl oz water",
            "1 large bunch fresh basil"
        ]
    },
    "steps": [
        "Place 150g/5\u00bdoz of the defrosted mixed fruit into a bowl.",
        "Add half the fresh berries, half the caster sugar and the basil leaves.",
        "Stir well and set to one side.",
        "Place the remainder of the frozen fruit and the sugar into a food processor and blend to a pur\u00e9e.",
        "Pour the sauce through a fine sieve and set aside.",
        "Remove the crusts from the bread and, using a chefs' ring, cut out four circles to fit the bottom of four ramekins. Repeat this process to create lids for the pudding.",
        "With the remaining bread cut out slices to line the inner edge of each ramekin.",
        "Lightly oil the inside of each ramekin, then line with cling film.",
        "Dip the small bread circles on one side in the fruit pur\u00e9e and place in the bottom of the mould, dipped-side down.",
        "Repeat with the bread slices to cover the sides, overlapping slightly.",
        "Fill the centre with the reserved basil-infused fruits and a drizzle of fruit pur\u00e9e (reserving some for the final rounds of bread) between the contents and press down well.",
        "Dip one side of the four remaining rounds of bread in the last of the fruit pur\u00e9e.",
        "Place in the fridge until ready to serve.",
        "To make the basil syrup, place the sugar and water into a saucepan over a high heat and bring to a simmer.",
        "Simmer for 6-8 minutes until a thick sugar syrup is formed, without caramelising the sugar.",
        "Add the basil leaves, then remove from the heat and leave to infuse and cool.",
        "Once cool, place into a food processor and blend to a sauce.",
        "Strain the basil syrup into a jug through a muslin-lined sieve.",
        "To serve, turn the puddings out onto a plate and garnish with any remaining fruit pur\u00e9e and place the remaining fresh berries over the top. Finish with a drizzle of basil syrup."
