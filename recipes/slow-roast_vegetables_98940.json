    "description": "Use any vegetables you like for this dish. Here Raymond Blanc uses fennel, red onion, violet artichokes, chicory and plenty of garlic cooked slowly to extract the sugars, giving a wonderful flavour and a soft melting texture. Each serving provides 846kcal, 30g protein, 55g carbohydrate (of which 25g sugars), 52g fat (of which 11g saturates), 16g fibre and 2.2g salt.",
