        "Heat the oil in a pan over a medium heat, add the spinach, a small grating of nutmeg and season with salt and pepper. Pop the lid on and cook on low for 1-2 minutes, until just wilted.",
        "Meanwhile, bring a pan of water to a boil and reduce the heat to a simmer. Add a splash of white wine vinegar and gently break the egg in as close to the surface as possible. Cook for 2-3 minutes or until the egg is cooked to your liking.",
        "To serve, place the spinach on the toast, top with the egg and season with salt and pepper."
