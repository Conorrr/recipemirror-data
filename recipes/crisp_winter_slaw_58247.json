        "Finely slice the red cabbage, fennel and celery and combine in a large salad bowl. Slice the apple into discs, lay onto a plate and squeeze a lemon over in order to stop it discolouring.",
        "Toast the walnuts in a dry frying pan for two minutes and set aside.",
        "For the dressing, take a separate bowl and to it add the red wine vinegar, a little salt, some Dijon mustard and both walnut and groundnut oil. Whisk them together.",
        "Now toss all the components together in a salad bowl. Crumble over large chunks of Stilton, trickle the dressing and serve with some of the green fronds from the fennel bulb."
