        "Any remaining soup will keep in the fridge for a few days or can be frozen in individual servings. When reheating, make sure it's heated thoroughly but don't boil it as this will ruin the taste and texture of the soup."

            "2 celery sticks, chopped",
            "200g/7oz carrots, chopped",
            "1 bay leaf",
            "1 large sprig fresh thyme",
            "750g/1\u00bdlb ripe plum or vine-ripened tomatoes, roughly chopped",
            "\u00bd tsp sugar",
            "salt and freshly ground black pepper",
            "200ml/7fl oz passata",
            "500ml/17fl oz vegetable stock",
            "100ml/3\u00bdfl oz single cream or low-fat cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche",
            "splash dry sherry",
            "crusty bread and butter, to serve"

    "steps": [
        "Heat the olive oil in a large saucepan and cook the onion for 5-6 minutes over a gentle heat until almost softened but not browned. Add the garlic, celery, carrots, bay leaf and thyme and cook for a further 6-7 minutes, stirring occasionally, making sure the vegetables don't stick to the base of the pan.",
        "Add the chopped tomatoes and sugar and season well with salt and pepper. Cook for a few minutes, then stir in the passata and vegetable stock. Bring to a simmer, cover with a lid and cook for 35-40 minutes, until all the vegetables are tender.",
        "Remove the bay leaf and thyme, then blend the soup in a liquidizer or food processor. This will probably have to be done in two batches. Pour the soup into a clean saucepan, passing it through a sieve if you want it really smooth. Stir in the cream, a splash of sherry and extra seasoning if required.",
        "Pour into large mugs or bowls and serve with fresh crusty buttered bread."
