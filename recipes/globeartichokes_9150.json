        "Pour water into a pan and add lemon juice, pinch of salt, coriander seeds, thyme and bay leaf.",
        "Remove stalk from artichoke by breaking it off and removing woody parts. Trim off the base and any rough outer leaves then cut off about the top 3cm/1\u00bcin of leaves. Using a small knife peel the artichokes removing all the green leaf parts. Rub with half a lemon and place in the pan, adding a little more water to cover if necessary.",
        "Bring to the boil then simmer for 6-8 minutes. Remove from heat and leave to cool in liquor - you may need to put a small plate on the artichokes to keep them submerged in the liquid. Leave artichokes in the liquor until you are ready to use them so they do not discolour.",
        "When ready to use remove the chokes carefully using a spoon."
