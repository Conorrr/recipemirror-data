    "steps": [
        "Place the broccoli into a pan of boiling salted water and boil for 3-4 minutes, or until just tender. Drain and refresh in cold water. Place into a bowl with the sorrel leaves, olive oil and lemon juice and mix together. Season, to taste, with salt and freshly ground black pepper.",
        "Pour the vegetable oil into a medium sized saucepan and heat until a small cube of bread dropped in sizzles and turns golden in 30 seconds. (CAUTION: hot oil can be dangerous. Do not leave unattended). Carefully lower the potato slices into the hot oil and deep fry until golden-brown. Remove with a slotted spoon and drain on kitchen paper.",
        "To serve, pile the dressed salad onto a serving plate, top with the potato chips and scatter over the goats' cheese shavings."
