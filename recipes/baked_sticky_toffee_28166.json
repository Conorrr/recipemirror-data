        "Place the dates and 300ml/10fl oz water in a saucepan and bring to the boil.",
        "Gradually add the golden syrup, treacle, vanilla and eggs to the butter mixture and mix thoroughly. Turn the mixer down to a slow speed and add the flour. Once all the ingredients are combined, turn off the mixer.",
        "Pur\u00e9e the water and date mixture and add the bicarbonate of soda. Quickly stir this into the batter while it is still hot.",
        "Once the mixture is combined, pour it into the buttered and floured cake tin and bake for 40\u201345 minutes, or until the top is firm to the touch. Leave the pudding to cool in the tin.",
