        "Thread two strawberries onto a bamboo skewer. Repeat with three more skewers to create four skewers with two strawberries each.",
        "Heat the olive oil, vinegar, caster sugar and half of the vanilla pod seeds in a non-stick frying pan. Once the sugar has dissolved, bring to the boil, then reduce the heat to simmer for two minutes or until thickened to a syrup.",
        "Add the strawberry skewers and cook for one minute, turning occasionally to coat the strawberries in syrup. Remove the strawberry skewers from the pan and set aside.",
        "Place the remaining vanilla seeds, the mascarpone and the icing sugar into a clean bowl and stir well to combine.",
        "To serve, arrange the skewers onto a plate, drizzle over any remaining syrup from the pan and serve with a spoonful of the mascarpone."
