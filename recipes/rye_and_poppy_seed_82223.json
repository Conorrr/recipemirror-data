        "For the rye and poppy seed biscuits, mix together all the ingredients for the biscuits with two tablespoons of water. Wrap into a ball and cover in cling film. Leave to chill in the fridge.",
        "For the beetroot jelly, line a 20cm/8in circular loose-bottomed cake tin with baking parchment. Blend the beetroot using a hand-held blender or food processor and strain the beetroot to retain the liquid (you will have about 100ml/3\u00bdfl oz liquid). Pour into a small pan and add the other ingredients for the jelly. Bring to the boil.",
        "Pour the jelly mixture into the lined tin and leave in the fridge to chill.",
        "For the rye and poppy seed biscuits, grease a baking tray. Roll out the biscuit dough and, using a 3cm/1\u00bcin diameter biscuit cutter, cut out circles. Transfer to the prepared baking tray and place in the freezer.",
        "Preheat the oven to 180C/fan oven 160C/350F/Gas 4.",
        "Mix the cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche in a bowl with some salt and pepper and the chopped tarragon. Spoon into a piping bag fitted with a small plain nozzle. Set aside.",
        "Bake the biscuits for 20-25 minutes, or until golden-brown \u2013 check after 15 minutes to make sure they aren\u2019t cooking too fast. Remove from the oven and leave to cool on a wire rack.",
        "Once cool, pipe the cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche onto the biscuit bases. Cut circles of beetroot jelly using the biscuit cutter you used for the biscuits and put on top of each. Serve."
