    "steps": [
        "Trim the turkey escalope and flatten using a meat hammer (alternatively place between two pieces of cling film and pound with a rolling pin).",
        "In a shallow bowl, mix the flour, paprika, mustard powder, salt and pepper together. In a separate bowl, beat two of the eggs.",
        "Pass the turkey escalopes through the flour mixture, dredge in beaten egg and coat in breadcrumbs, shaking off any excess at each stage.",
        "Heat a little olive oil in a large frying pan. Fry the turkey presentation-side down first until golden-brown (you may need to do this in batches). Turn over and fry the other side until cooked through. Remove from the pan and drain on kitchen paper.",
        "Heat a separate frying pan and fry the remaining eggs in vegetable oil until cooked to your liking.",
        "Put the escalopes on serving plates, with the fried eggs on top. Arrange the anchovies around the plate.",
        "Discard any excess fat from the frying pan and add the vinegar. Simmer until the volume of liquid has reduced by half. Shake in the butter and strain through a fine sieve into a clean pan. Add the capers and parsley. Pour the sauce over the eggs and serve immediately."
