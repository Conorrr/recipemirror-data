            "4 chicken breasts, boneless and skinless",
            "40g/1\u00bdoz shelled hazelnuts",
            "25g/1oz parmesan, freshly grated, plus extra for serving",
            "2 lemons, zested then cut in half",
            "2 sprigs thyme, leaves only",
            "40g/1\u00bdoz Japanese panko breadcrumbs",
            "75g/3oz plain flour",
            "sea salt and freshly ground black pepper",
            "2 free-range eggs, beaten",

    "steps": [
        "Put the chicken between two pieces of greaseproof paper and flatten using a rolling pin until about 1cm thick.",
        "Put the hazelnuts, parmesan, lemon zest and thyme into a food processor and blend to fine crumbs.",
        "Add the breadcrumbs and pulse quickly to just break up the crumbs, then tip out onto a plate.",
        "Scatter the flour onto a plate and season with salt and black pepper. Dust the chicken in the flour.",
        "Put the beaten eggs in a bowl. Dip the chicken into the egg, then into the hazelnut breadcrumbs, making sure to coat each side thoroughly.",
        "Heat the butter in a large frying pan, add the chicken breasts and fry until golden-brown - about five minutes on each side - basting with the butter as you go.",
        "Drain onto kitchen paper and then finish with a little more parmesan cheese.",
        "To serve, lay the chicken escalope on each plate and drizzle over all the remaining butter in the frying pan, then finish with a squeeze of lemon juice.",
        "Pile the salad leaves alongside with a wedge of lemon."
