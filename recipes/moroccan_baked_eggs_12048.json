    "description": "Baked eggs are the perfect dish for a lazy brunch. If you like your eggs spicy just add a little chilli powder. As part of an Intermittent diet plan, 1 serving provides 2 of your 6 daily vegetable portions. This meal provides 170 kcal per portion. If eating it as part of a daily Intermittent diet menu, also enjoy 200ml skimmed milk (70 calories).",
