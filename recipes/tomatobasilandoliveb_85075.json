        "For the tapenade, place the olives, garlic, basil and oil into a mini blender. Season well with salt and freshly ground black pepper and blend until the ingredients are combined but retain a chunky texture.",

        "Heat a griddle pan and griddle the ciabatta slices for 3-4 minutes on each side, or until golden-brown.",
        "To serve, spread the tapenade over the ciabatta slices, top with the chopped tomato and garnish with basil leaves."
