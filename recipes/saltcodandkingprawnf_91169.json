        "Bring a pan of salted water to the boil and blanch the prawns for 30 seconds. Drain the prawns and allow to cool. Cut the prawns into small pieces.",
        "Boil the potatoes in a pan of boiling salted water until tender, drain and mash.",
        "In a large bowl, mix together the flaked pollack, prawns, mashed potatoes, spring onions, red chillies, fish sauce, lime zest and juice and the curry powder, coriander, salt and freshly ground black pepper.",
        "Using your hands, shape the mixture into fishcakes, place on a tray or large plate, cover with cling film and chill in in the refrigerator for 30 minutes.",
