        "Heat two tablespoons of the oil in a large frying pan over a medium heat. Add the mince and fry until golden-brown all over.",

        "Add the chilli powder, cumin and cinnamon and season, to taste, with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Fry for a further 4-5 minutes, stirring well.",
        "Remove the mince from the pan using a slotted spoon and add to the vegetable mixture.",
        "Add the drained kidney beans and the chopped tinned tomatoes and bring the mixture to the boil. Reduce the heat until the mixture is simmering, then half-cover the pan with a lid and simmer for about an hour, stirring every now and again to stop it from catching on the bottom of the pan.",
        "To serve, ladle the chilli into four serving bowls. Drizzle over the soured cream. Sprinkle with the chopped coriander. Garnish with the lime wedges and serve with nachos alongside."
