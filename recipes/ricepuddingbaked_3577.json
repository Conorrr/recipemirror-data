        "Wash the rice, put it into a pie-dish with the sugar, pour in the milk, and stir these ingredients well together.",
        "Then add the butter cut up into very small pieces, or, instead of this, the above proportion of finely-minced suet.",
        "Grate a little nutmeg over the top, and bake the pudding in a moderate oven, from 1\u00bd to 2 hours. As the rice is not previously cooked, care must be taken that the pudding is very slowly baked, to give plenty of time for the rice to swell, and for it to be very thoroughly done."
