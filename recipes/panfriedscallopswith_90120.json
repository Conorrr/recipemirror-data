        "For the scallops, season the scallops with salt and freshly ground black pepper and drizzle over the olive oil. Heat a frying pan until smoking and sear the scallops for 30 seconds to one minute on both sides, or until just cooked through and golden-brown all over. Remove from the pan and keep warm.",
        "For the salsa, place all of the salsa ingredients to the pan used to cook the scallops and heat for 1-2 minutes to warm through.",
        "Arrange a handful of rocket on a serving plate and place the scallops on top. Spoon the salsa over and serve."
