        "Blanch the asparagus for 1\u00bd minutes in boiling water. Refresh in iced water and drain well.",
        "Take half of the chives and place in a sieve, then run hot water over them for a few seconds until wilted. Drain well and dry on paper towels.",
        "Take 3-4 spears of asparagus and tie together using the blanched chives.The chives should be about 4cm from the tip of the asparagus, and the bundles should be trimmed to a length of 5-6 cm. Do not trim the asparagus before you tie it as the short spears will be difficult to handle. Arrange the bundles on a plate.",
        "For the dip: combine the cr\u00e9me fra\u00efche and truffle oil and season well. Finely chop the remaining chives and add to the mixture.",
        "Transfer the dip into a serving bowl and serve with the bundles."
