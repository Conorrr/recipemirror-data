        "For the lamb, brush the meat with the oil and season well with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Heat an ovenproof griddle pan until smoking, then chargrill the lamb for 3-4 minutes, or until golden-brown. Turn the lamb over, add the balsamic vinegar and cook for 3-4 minutes, or until the vinegar has reduced to a sticky consistency and the lamb is cooked to your liking.",
