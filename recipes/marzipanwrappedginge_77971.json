        "To make the cinnamon fingers, preheat the oven to 200C/400F/Gas 6.",
        "Lay two squares of filo on a floured surface. Brush one with melted butter and sprinkle with cinnamon. Place the other square over and repeat the brush and sprinkle process.",
        "Cut into three inch by one inch fingers. Place on a non-stick baking-sheet and bake for five minutes.",
        "To make the ginger cake, mix together the cream cheese, stem ginger, syrup and vanilla seeds in a large bowl.",
        "Set a three inch chef's ring in the centre of a plate. Spoon in the mixture packing it down well. Use a palette knife to flatten the top.",
        "Release and remove the ring by gently warming the edges with a mini blow torch or sliding a knife around the inner edges.",
        "Roll the marzipan into a long thin strip. Wrap the marzipan strip around the cake. Lightly caramelise the marzipan wrap with a mini blow torch.",
        "To serve, place the cinnamon fingers on top of the cake. Garnish with the cake with 2 mint leaves and place the peach halves beside."
