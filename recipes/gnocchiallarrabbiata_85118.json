        "For the arrabbiata sauce, heat the oil in a frying pan and gently fry the onion and garlic until soft. Add the chilli, vinegar and sugar and stir well.",
        "Add the chopped tomatoes and simmer until the tomatoes break down and go mushy. Season with salt and pepper.",

    "tips": [
        "White wine vinegar is handy to have in your store cupboard as it can be used in lots of sauces and dressings. Pick up a bottle for as little as 80p. The heat of chillies varies so test a little before adding it to the sauce and adjust the amount accordingly."
