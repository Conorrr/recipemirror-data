    "steps": [
        "Preheat the oven to 180C/350F/Gas 4. Grease and flour the moulds, then line the bases with a disc of oiled parchment paper.",
        "To make the pudding, soak the dates in the boiling water for five minutes, then blend in a food processor until smooth. Add the remaining ingredients and blend again until well combined.",
        "Spoon the mixture into the prepared moulds (but not right to the top, as they rise quite a bit) and bake in the preheated oven for 20 minutes, or until they are risen and firm. (You can check they are cooked by inserting a skewer into the middle - if it comes out clean, the pudding is ready.)",
        "Ten minutes before the puddings are ready, make the toffee sauce. Melt the butter, coconut palm sugar, blackstrap molasses and maple syrup in a saucepan over low heat, then simmer for a few minutes. Gradually stir in the soy cream, vanilla extract and salt and bring to the boil for 1\u20132 minutes, or until slightly thickened. Keep warm until ready to serve.",
        "Leave the puddings to cool in their moulds for a few minutes, then turn out onto serving plates. Spoon the toffee sauce over and around with a little extra soy cream to top it off."
