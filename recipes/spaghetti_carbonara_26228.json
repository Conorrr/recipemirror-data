        "Boil the pasta in a large pan of boiling salted water according to packet instructions.",
        "Meanwhile, heat the olive oil in a large frying pan over a medium-high heat and fry the pancetta and garlic for 2-3 minutes, until the pancetta is crisp and browned. Reduce the heat to low.",
        "In a bowl, lightly beat the eggs with the cream and most of the grated cheese, reserving a little cheese for the garnish. Season generously with freshly ground black pepper.",
        "Drain the cooked spaghetti, reserving a few tablespoons of the cooking water.",

        "Divide the pasta between two serving bowls and sprinkle with the remaining cheese and the chopped herbs. Serve immediately with the rocket salad on the side."
