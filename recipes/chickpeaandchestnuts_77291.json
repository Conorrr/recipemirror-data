        "Pur\u00e9e the chestnuts or chestnut pur\u00e9e in a food processor with the oil of your choice and the sherry, marsala or port until it is smooth.",
        "Add the chickpeas and pur\u00e9e briefly if you want to keep some 'crunchiness' in the chickpeas; if you want a totally smooth stuffing it does not matter how vigorously you pur\u00e9e them.",
        "Remove from the processor. Add sunflower seeds and season to taste.",
        "You can use the stuffing inside a turkey, bake it in little balls alongside the bird, or use it as a p\u00e2t\u00e9 on toast."
