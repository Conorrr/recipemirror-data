        "In a clean pan make the sauce. Heat the butter until it starts to turn golden-brown. Remove from the heat and add the lemon juice, parsley and fennel seeds.",
        "To serve, lay the rhubarb in the middle of serving plates. Carefully lay the mackerel on top. Spoon the sauce over and serve."
