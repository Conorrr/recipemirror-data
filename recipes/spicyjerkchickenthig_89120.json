        "Heat the butter in a frying pan until frothing, then fry the chicken thighs for 7-8 minutes on both sides, or until golden-brown and cooked through. (The juices will run clear when the chicken is pierced in the thickest part with a skewer.)",
        "For the rice, put the rice in a saucepan and cover with double the amount of boiling water. Boil for 7-8 minutes, then add the peppers. Cook for a further 2-3 minutes, or until all the liquid is absorbed and the rice is tender. Fluff up the rice with a fork.",
        "To serve, spoon the rice and peppers onto a serving plate and place the fried chicken thighs on the side. Garnish with the lemon wedge and serve."
