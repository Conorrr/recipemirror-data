        "Preheat the oven to 200C/400F/Gas 6.",

        "Heat a chargrill pan until hot and fry the steak for one minute on each side, or until golden-brown on both sides. Transfer to a baking tray, place the Stilton slices on top of the steak and drizzle over the honey. Bake in the oven for 4-5 mintues (for medium), or until the steak is cooked to your liking, and the cheese is bubbling and golden-brown. Remove from the oven and set the steak aside on a warm plate to rest for 10 minutes. Once rested, slice into three pieces.",
        "For the Brussels sprouts, crush the Brussels sprouts in a pan with a potato masher. Stir in the chilli powder and season, to taste, with salt and freshly ground black pepper.",
        "To serve, pack the crushed Brussels sprouts into a 10cm/4in chefs' ring in the centre of a serving plate. Remove the ring, then top with sliced Stilton-topped steak."
