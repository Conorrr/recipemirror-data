        "Line a bowl with a clean tea towel and grate the new potatoes into the bowl. Twist the tea towel to squeeze out the excess moisture from the potatoes into the bowl.",
        "Heat the olive oil in a small frying pan, add the grated potatoes to the pan and season well with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Fry the potatoes for 5-6 minutes, or until they come together to form a cake, adding a little butter down the sides of the r\u00f6sti every two minutes.",
        "Turn the r\u00f6sti over using a fish slice and cook for a further 3-4 minutes, again adding a little butter down the sides to crispen the edges. Remove the r\u00f6sti from the pan when golden-brown and drain on kitchen paper.",
        "To serve, cut the r\u00f6sti into quarters and place a poached egg on top."
