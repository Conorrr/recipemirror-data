        "Add the plain flour, rice flour and salt. Rub the mixture together with your hands until the mixture resembles coarse breadcrumbs.",
        "Pressing it against the side of the bowl, bring the mixture together to form a dough. Place dough in the centre of the tray. Knead and push outwards until 1cm/\u00bdin thick all over. Prick the surface of the dough all over with fork and place in fridge for 25 minutes.",
        "Bake for 30-35 minutes, or until pale golden brown in colour.",

        "Use a Westie dog shaped template to cut out the biscuit. Leave to cool.",
        "Using a palette knife spread the royal icing thinly over the shortbread, leaving a 1cm/\u00bdin gap from the edge all the way around .",
        "Roll two small balls of black fondant for the eyes and a triangular piece for the nose. For the collar, roll a thin sausage of red fondant and flatten. Place the fondant pieces on the cookie."
