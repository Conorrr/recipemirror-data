        "Melt the butter in a deep frying pan over a medium heat. Add the onion and garlic and fry gently until translucent.",
        "Drain the soaked porcini, reserving about 300ml/10\u00bdfl oz of the soaking water.",
        "Increase the heat to high and add the mushrooms to the pan. Cook over a high heat for 2-3 minutes and then add the rice. If at this point the mixture is drying out add a splash of olive oil. Fry the mixture for 2-3 minutes until the rice is slightly translucent.",
        "Add the wine and simmer until the liquid is mostly absorbed, then add a ladleful of stock.",
        "Continue to cook the rice, adding a ladleful of stock at a time and stirring continuously until the liquid is absorbed by the rice. The rice should take about 18-20 minutes to cook.",
        "Once the rice is tender, take the pan off the heat and stir in the parsley and parmesan.",
        "Divide the risotto among four serving plates, drizzle with truffle oil and serve."
