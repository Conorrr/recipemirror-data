        "For the mustard soured cream, place the yoghurt in a small bowl with the cream, mustard, honey, lemon zest and olive oil. Season, to taste, with salt and freshly ground black pepper and stir well.",
        "For the herb salad, place the herbs into a bowl and drizzle over the vinegar and oil. Season, to taste, with salt and freshly ground black pepper and stir to coat the leaves.",
        "To serve, place one of the potato r\u00f6stis onto a warmed plate and spoon some of the prawns on top. Drizzle over a little of the mustard soured cream. Repeat these layers until all of the ingredients have been used up. Garnish with the dressed herb salad and serve at once."
