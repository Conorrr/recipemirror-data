Add the chopped spring onions, olive oil and crabmeat, season, to taste, with salt and freshly ground black pepper and stir together. Spoon onto a serving plate and top with the roasted tomatoes.",
        "For the mayonnaise, place the egg yolks, mustard and white wine vinegar into a bowl and whisk until combined. Gradually add the olive oil in a thin stream, whisking continuously until the mixture is thickened and emulsified. Add a little lemon juice, to taste, and stir in the chives.",
