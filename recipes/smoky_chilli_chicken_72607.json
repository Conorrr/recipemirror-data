    "steps": [
        "For spiced potato wedges, preheat the oven to 200C/400F/Gas 6.",
        "Mix the spices and salt together in a bowl with the olive oil, then add the potatoes and toss well to coat thoroughly.",
        "Tip out onto a flat oven tray and roast for 30 minutes, turning half way through, until the wedges are golden-brown, crunchy around the edges but tender when pierced with a knife.",
        "For the wings, preheat the oven to 220C/425F/Gas 7.",
        "Place the wings onto a roasting tray in the oven and roast for 15-20 minutes, or until golden-brown and cooked through.",
        "Meanwhile, make the dressing. Heat a frying pan until hot, add the extra virgin olive oil and garlic and cook for a couple of minutes over a gentle heat \u2013 you don\u2019t want to burn the garlic. Add the smoked paprika and sherry vinegar.",
        "Heat a clean frying pan until hot, add the olive oil and padron peppers and then fry for 2-3 minutes, or until the peppers are charred. Add some salt.",
        "Pile the peppers into a serving bowl and top with some more sea salt.",
        "To serve, put the wings onto a serving bowl and drizzle with some of the warm garlic and chilli dressing. Serve with the wedges and peppers."
