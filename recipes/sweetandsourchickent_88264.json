        "Heat the olive oil in a frying pan, add the chicken thighs and season well with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Fry over a low-medium heat until golden-brown on all sides.",
        "Add the onion and fry until softened. Add the sun-dried tomatoes, soy sauce, white wine vinegar and honey and simmer for 2-3 minutes, or until the chicken is completely cooked through - you can test this by piercing the thickest part with a skewer and checking that the juices run clear.",
        "Stir in the chopped parsley and then spoon onto a serving plate. Garnish with rosemary sprigs and serve."
