        "For the miso halibut, stir together the sake, mirin, white miso paste and caster sugar in a shallow dish. Remove a couple of tablespoons of the marinade and put it in squeezy bottle for the dressing and set aside. Add the fish to the shallow dish, cover and leave to marinate in the fridge for 24 hours.",
        "When you are ready to cook the fish, preheat the grill to high. Wipe any excess marinade from the fish and place the fish on a baking tray.",
        "Grill the fish for three minutes on each side, or until cooked to your liking.",
        "For the teriyaki green veg and miso dressing, first make the teriyaki sauce. Heat a frying pan until hot, add the rice wine, sake, mirin, soy sauce and caster sugar and bring the mixture to a simmer.",
        "Simmer for 1-2 minutes, or until the mixture has just thickened.",
        "Heat a large wok and add the oil. Once the oil is hot, add the shallot, garlic, ginger, salt and the greens and cook for 2-3 minutes. Pour in the teriyaki sauce and stock (or water) and stir.",
        "To serve, use the marinade in the squeezy bottle to dress each of four plates. Place the greens on each plate topped with the miso fish. Garnish with the red amaranth and coriander cress."
