        "Preheat the oven to 200C/400F/Gas 6.",
        "Sift the flour and baking powder into a large mixing bowl.",
        "Rub the butter into the flour using your fingertips, until the mixture resembles coarse, fresh breadcrumbs.",
        "Pour in the milk and mix with a wooden spoon to create a soft dough.",
        "Add the crumbled cheese and ensure it is evenly distributed by gently kneading the dough with your hands.",
        "Shape the dough into a rough round and place on a baking tray dusted with flour.",
        "Press down on the top of the ball to flatten it slightly, then brush it with a little milk to glaze.",
        "Grate some extra cheese over the top, then score a deep cross into the dough with a sharp knife to allow it to break into individual pieces when cooked.",
        "Bake in the preheated oven for around 30 minutes, or until the cheese topping looks golden-brown and crisp.",
        "Serve warm with your favourite chutney or pickle."
