        "Preheat the oven to 180C/350F/Gas 4.",
        "For the fennel yoghurt, heat the oil in an ovenproof casserole over a medium heat. Add the garlic and fennel and fry for 4-5 minutes, or until golden-brown and slightly softened.",
        "Add the lemon juice to the mixture, stir well, then cover and transfer to the oven. Roast for 15-20 minutes, or until the fennel is tender. Set aside to cool.",
        "For the aubergine chips, mix together the breadcrumbs, percorino, chilli flakes, salt and pepper in a shallow bowl.",
        "Place the plain flour onto a shallow plate and beat the eggs in a shallow bowl.",
        "Roll the aubergine sticks in the flour, then dip into the egg and finally coat in the breadcrumb mixture.",
        "Heat the oil in a deep-fat fryer to 150C/300F. Alternatively, heat the oil in a deep heavy-based frying pan until a breadcrumb sizzles and turns golden-brown when dropped into it. (CAUTION: hot oil can be dangerous. Do not leave unattended.)",
        "Transfer the coated aubergine sticks to the hot oil to deep-fry for about six minutes, or until golden-brown.",
        "Remove from the oil with a slotted spoon and drain on kitchen paper.",
        "Combine the roasted fennel, roasted garlic and any roasting juices with the fennel seeds in a blender. You may need to add some more olive oil or lemon juice, to taste. Blend until the mixture is a smooth pur\u00e9e.",
        "Pass the pur\u00e9ed fennel through a sieve and stir into the Greek yoghurt.",
        "Serve the fennel yoghurt in a bowl and with the fried aubergine sticks and watercress on the side."
