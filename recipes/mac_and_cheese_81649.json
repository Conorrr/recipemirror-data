    "description": "Using a bit of emulsion science, the sodium citrate in this recipe enables you to make a smooth sauce that has all the flavour of the cheese that went into it - much more so than a traditional white sauce, and without any greasiness. Although cheese lovers might be tempted to boost the sauce-to-pasta ratio, keep in mind that the sauce is very rich. A little goes a long way.",
