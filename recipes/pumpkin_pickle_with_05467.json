        "Preheat the oven to 200C/400F/Gas 6.",
        "Cut a 6cm/2\u00bdin piece of squash and peel, then cut into four 15mm/\u00bein thick slices and set aside. Cut another piece (about 300g/10\u00bdoz), peel and cut into 1cm/\u00bdin cubes.",
        "Season the chicken breast with salt and black pepper.",
        "Heat a frying pan until hot. Add a knob of butter, the olive oil and the chicken breast skin-side down and fry on each side for 1-2 minutes, or until golden-brown. Add the squash slices and place in the oven for 15 minutes, or until both are cooked through.",
        "Meanwhile, heat a saut\u00e9 pan until hot. Add the remaining butter and, when melted, cook the shallot, garlic and the cubes of squash. Cook for a couple of minutes.",
        "Stir in the sugar and cook until it starts to caramelise, then add a few tablespoons of water and the ginger, turmeric, fenugreek and black onion seeds. Cook for another couple of minutes.",
        "Add another 3-4 tablespoons of water and stir to combine, then add the chilli, coriander and a generous pinch of salt. Remove from the heat and stir in the mango chutney.",
        "To serve, place two slices of pumpkin on each plate, top with a chicken breast and then spoon some pickle alongside."
