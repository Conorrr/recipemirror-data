        "Place a wire rack over the potatoes and onions and sit the lamb on top.",
        "Roast for about another hour, depending on how well you like your meat cooked. Allow the lamb to rest as long as you have cooked it.",
        "For the fricass\u00e9e of onions and peas, heat a medium frying pan and add the butter. Once melted add the baby onions. Cook for 3-4 minutes, or until golden-brown all over.",

        "To serve, slice the lamb and serve in shallow bowls. Place the potatoes alongside and add the onions and peas."
