        "Place the rice into a heavy-based saucepan and add the boiling water. Bring to the boil, then cover with a tight-fitting lid and reduce to a low heat. Simmer for 15-20 minutes, or until all of the liquid has been absorbed and the rice is cooked al dente.",
        "Uncover the pan and remove from the heat. Fluff up the rice grains with a fork, stir in the remaining ingredients and serve immediately."
