        "For the p\u00e2t\u00e9, remove the flesh from the fish, discarding all the skin and bones, and place into a blender. Add the lemon juice and blend quickly with the cream to a slightly coarse p\u00e2t\u00e9. Transfer the p\u00e2t\u00e9 from the blender to a bowl, add the chives and season to taste with sea salt and freshly ground black pepper. Spoon the p\u00e2t\u00e9 into a pot, smooth over the surface and place in the fridge.",
        "To make the dressing, place both the vinegars in a bowl. Whisk in 225ml/8fl oz of the olive oil then check the flavour for balance of oil and acidity, adding more oil if needed.",
        "Shape the p\u00e2t\u00e9 into quenelles. Dress the salad leaves with a little of the vinaigrette and cut the eggs in half. Place the beetroot in overlapping circles on a plate, place the salad leaves on top of the beetroot, top with the p\u00e2t\u00e9 and the egg and garnish with a few chervil leaves. Serve with slices of warm Melba toast."
