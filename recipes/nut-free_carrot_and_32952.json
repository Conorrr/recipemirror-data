        "Add the carrot to the food processor and pulse a few times to combine, being careful not to over-blend (the carrot should provide texture and colour to this snack).",

        "Bake in the oven for 30-35 minutes, or until cooked through and browned on top. Remove and set aside to cool slightly, then cut into squares. Serve warm or cold."
