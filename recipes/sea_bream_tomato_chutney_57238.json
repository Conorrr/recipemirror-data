        "For the sea bream, place all the ingredients except the sparkling water, sea bream and vegetable oil in a large glass bowl and mix to combine.",
        "Gradually add the water and lightly whisk, then place in the fridge to rest.",
        "For the cucumber relish, place all the ingredients in a large bowl, stir and set aside.",
        "To make the chutney, preheat the grill to hot.",
        "Place the tomatoes on a baking tray and cook under the grill for 5-10 minutes.",
        "Remove from the grill and add the chillies, garlic, shallot and ginger. Sprinkle with the sugar and place back under the grill for a further five minutes.",
        "Remove from the grill and tip the cooked tomatoes and other ingredients onto a chopping board. Chop to a pulp, then add to a pan and cook over a medium heat for 20 minutes. Set aside until ready to serve.",
        "For the samphire, place a pan of boiling water on the hob, add the samphire and cook for 2-3 minutes. Prepare a bowl of ice cold water.",
        "Drain the samphire, tip it into the cold water and once, cool, drain again and set aside.",
        "Place a large pan on the heat and add enough vegetable oil for deep fat frying. (CAUTION: hot oil can be dangerous. Do not leave unattended.) Heat to 180C/350F, or until a bread cube sizzles and turns golden-brown when dropped in the oil.",
        "Remove the batter from the fridge, dip each fish strip in the batter and deep fry for three minutes, or until golden-brown and crisp.",
        "Place a frying pan on the heat and, once hot, add the butter and gently fry the samphire for 2-3 minutes.",
        "To serve, arrange the cucumber relish, chutney and samphire on each plate and place the battered fish on top."
