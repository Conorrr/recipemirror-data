            "1 x 1.2 kg/2lb 11oz lamb shoulder (preferably Pyrenean), knuckle removed",
            "1 tsp sea salt",
            "4 bulbs wet (new season) garlic",
            "olive oil, for frying",
            "1 x 400g/14oz tin chopped tomatoes (or several really ripe tomatoes)",
            "1 tbsp whole cumin seeds, toasted",
            "1\u00bd litres/2\u00bd pints chicken stock",
            "salt and pepper",
            "1 sprig rosemary",

        "Season the lamb liberally with sea salt. Heat a large frying pan and brown the meat all over (the lamb fat and the salt make a wonderful salty crust).",

        "Break up the wet garlic into individual cloves (leave the skin on). Gently fry the garlic in olive oil, then add the tomatoes, cumin and stock. Season with salt and pepper (remember there will be plenty of salt on the lamb already).",
        "Tip into a roasting tin and add the rosemary, cumin and paprika. Place the lamb on top.",
        "Cover with baking parchment and roast for 2-3 hours, or until the meat falls away from the bone."
