        "For the vanilla rice, place the rice, milk, cream, sugar and vanilla pod into a non-stick saucepan. Stir well and cook gently for five minutes or until the rice has softened but still retains a little bite. Remove the vanilla pod as this can be re-used.",
        "For the oranges, place the segmented oranges into a small bowl. Sprinkle the cinnamon and drizzle the clear honey over the top.",
        "To serve, place the rice pudding into a clean bowl. Sprinkle with ground cinnamon on and serve with the oranges on the side."
