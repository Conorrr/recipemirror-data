        "Preheat the oven to 200C/400F/Gas 6.",
        "For the paste, place the capers, garlic and olive oil in a mortar and grind with a pestle to make a paste.",
        "For the sole, line up the slices of prosciutto on a clean work surface, well spaced apart.",
        "Place one sole fillet on each slice of prosciutto, brush the fish with a light layer of the caper paste, then top with a sprig of parsley. Season with salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste.",
        "Carefully roll up each fillet in the prosciutto slice and tie to fasten using a chive.",
        "Line a baking tray or an ovenproof dish with greaseproof paper and place the wrapped and rolled fish fillets on the dish. Bake in the oven for approximately 10-15 minutes, or until the fish is just cooked.",
        "For the sauce, heat the olive oil in a small frying pan and add the bay leaves, shallot, garlic and parsley. Fry on a medium heat for about seven minutes, or until the shallot has softened.",
        "In a small bowl, whisk together the wine and cornflour. Add the cornflour mixture to the pan. Stir well and season to taste with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Cook for a further five minutes, or until the sauce has thickened.",
        "Remove the sole fillets from the oven and transfer them to a large serving dish, or onto four individual plates, and pour over the sauce before serving. Serve with the boiled baby potatoes."
