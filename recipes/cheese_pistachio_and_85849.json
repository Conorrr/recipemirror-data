    "description": "Savoury cakes are very popular in France, they appear in boulangeries and with a side salad on lunch menus in chic caf\u00e9s, but they\u2019re most likely to appear at a picnic. They are super-simple to make and can be adapted to use whatever leftovers you have in your fridge \u2013 just follow the basic batter recipe and get creative with the fillings!",

        "Preheat the oven to 180C/350F/Gas 4 and line a loaf tin measuring 22x11cm/8\u00bdx4\u00bcin across the top and 6cm/2\u00bdin deep with baking paper.",
        "In a bowl, mix together the flour, baking powder, goat\u2019s cheese, pistachios and prunes.",
        "In a separate bowl, whisk the eggs until fluffy and pale in colour. Then gradually whisk in the oil, milk and yoghurt. Season with the salt and freshly-ground black pepper.",
        "Fold the flour mixture into the whisked eggs. Try not to overbeat as this will make the end result tough (it\u2019s better to undermix).",
        "Pour the batter into the prepared tin.",
        "Bake for 30-40 minutes or until a metal skewer inserted in the centre of the cake comes out clean.",
        "Leave to cool in the tin."

    "tips": [
        "Use a rubber spatula rather than a whisk to prevent overbeating the flour."
