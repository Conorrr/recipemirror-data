    "description": "Savoury cakes are very popular in France, they appear in boulangeries and with a side salad on lunch menus in chic caf\u00e9s, but they\u2019re most likely to appear at a picnic. They are super-simple to make and can be adapted to use whatever leftovers you have in your fridge \u2013 just follow the basic batter recipe and get creative with the fillings!",
