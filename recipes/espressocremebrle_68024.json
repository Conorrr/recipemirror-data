        "In a separate bowl, whisk the egg, yolks, sugar and cheese together.",
        "Once the milk is near boiling point pour over the egg mixture, mix well, and strain through a colander and back into the pan. Put the mixture back on the heat and whisk constantly until it begins to thicken.",
        "Pour the mixture into martini glasses or brul\u00e9e dishes and allow to set in the fridge for 3-4 hours.",
        "Once set, sprinkle the top of the brul\u00e9e with sugar and place under a grill for 2 minutes or use a gas burner to colour the sugar and create the brul\u00e9e topping."
