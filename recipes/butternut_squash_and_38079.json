        "For the soup, heat a large lidded saucepan and add 2 tablespoons of the oil. Once hot, add the shallot, thyme and mussels and cook for 1 minute. Add the wine and cover with a lid. Cook for 2-3 minutes or until all mussels have opened. Discard any that do not open.",

        "Ladle the soup into serving bowls and garnish with the cro\u00fbtons, reserved mussels, cresses and a drizzle of oil."
