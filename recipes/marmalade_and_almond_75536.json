    "description": "This is based on a classic orange polenta cake. However, I find polenta (a type of cornmeal) can have a slightly gritty texture. I now use semolina instead \u2013 which is ground from hard durum wheat. It gives a lovely, fine texture to the cake. If you\u2019d prefer to keep the cake wheat-free, use polenta or fine cornmeal instead.",

    "steps": [
        "Preheat the oven to 180C/350F/Gas 4. Grease a 20cm/8in springform cake tin and line the base with baking parchment.",
        "Cream the butter and sugar together until pale and fluffy. Beat in the marmalade then beat in the eggs, one at a time.",
        "In a separate bowl, thoroughly combine the semolina, almonds and baking powder. Add to the mixture, along with the orange zest, and fold in. Finally, mix in the orange juice to create a mixture with a soft dropping consistency.",
        "Spoon the batter into the prepared cake tin and smooth the top with the back of a spoon.",
        "Bake for 35 minutes, or until the cake is golden-brown. Leave in the tin to cool for five minutes, then remove and transfer to a wire rack to cool completely.",
        "To make the frosting, beat the butter and cream cheese together. Sift in the icing sugar and beat until smooth. Use a palette knife to spread the frosting on top of the cake. Chill before serving, so the icing sets."
