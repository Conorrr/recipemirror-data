        "Remove any pin bones from the trout fillets, then score the skin.",

        "Heat the butter and oil in a frying pan and fry the cakes until golden brown on both sides. Remove from the pan and keep hot.",
        "For the sea trout, fry the trout fillets in hot olive oil, skin-side down first, for about two minutes on each side.",
        "To serve, place a laver bread cake in the centre of each plate and spoon the warm artichokes on top. Place the trout fillets on the vegetables and serve."
