        "Place the custard into a separate large bowl, add the passion fruit seeds and pulp and mix well. Gently fold in the whisked egg whites. Spoon the mixture into the prepared ramekins and place onto a baking sheet.",
        "Transfer to the oven and bake for 15-20 minutes, or until risen and golden-brown.",
        "Meanwhile, for the bananas, heat the butter in a non-stick pan until it turns slightly brown. Add the sugar and the bananas and cook, stirring frequently, until the bananas are golden-brown all over.",
        "To serve, place the souffl\u00e9s onto serving plates in their ramekin dishes. Place the bananas alongside and serve with a scoop of vanilla ice cream. Garnish with fresh mint."
