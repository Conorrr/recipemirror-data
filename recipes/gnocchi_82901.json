            "1 kg/2\u00bclb potatoes, unpeeled",
            "olive oil, for frying",
            "1 onion, finely chopped",
            "100g/3\u00bdoz Swiss chard, boiled, squeezed of water and chopped",
            "1 free-range egg",
            "300g/10\u00bdoz '00' flour, plus extra for dusting",
            "1 tsp salt"

    "steps": [
        "Boil the potatoes, with their skins on, until tender.",
        "Heat the olive oil in a frying pan and fry the onion until golden.",
        "Peel the potatoes while they are still hot, then pass the potatoes, onion and Swiss chard through a food mill or ricer. Place the mixture in a bowl.",
        "Stir in the egg and flour to form a soft, pliable dough.",
        "Divide the dough into pieces the size of a small fist and roll them out into lengths about 2cm/\u00bein thick. Cut the lengths into 2cm/\u00bein long pieces. The gnocchi can be frozen at this stage; spread them out on a well-floured tray and put them in the freezer. When frozen, shake off any excess flour and put them in a bag. Use within 3 months.",
        "To cook, boil the gnocchi in salted water for about two minutes (allowing 1-2 minutes extra cooking time if cooking from frozen). When they're cooked they will bob up to the surface.",
        "Drain well and serve immediately with the sauce of your choice."
