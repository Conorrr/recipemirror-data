        "For the plum chutney, heat a frying pan until hot, add the caster sugar and cook until melted and a light golden-brown colour.",
        "Add the chopped plums, onion, vinegar, star anise and cinnamon and cook for 5-8 minutes, or until the plums are tender and slightly pulpy.",
        "Season with a little salt and freshly ground black pepper and set aside to cool. If making in advance, store the chutney in an air-tight container in the fridge.",
        "For the mozzarella, wrap the slices of Parma ham around the mozzarella and set aside.",
        "Heat a large frying pan until hot, add one tablespoon of the olive oil and fry the parcels on each side until just crisp and the mozzarella is just starting to ooze.",
        "Sprinkle over the sesame seeds.",
        "Heat a griddle pan until searing hot, then drizzle the rest of the olive oil over the ciabatta and place onto the griddle.",
        "Char-grill on each side for 1-2 minutes, or until golden-brown.",
        "To serve, spoon some chutney onto each of four plates, lay the wedges of mozzarella alongside and serve with the bread."
