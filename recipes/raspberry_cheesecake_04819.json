        "Stir in the melted butter until well combined. Press the mixture into the base of the paper cases, reserving a tablespoon to garnish.",
        "For the filling, beat the cream cheese in a bowl until smooth, then stir in the plain flour, caster sugar, vanilla extract, egg and egg yolk and soured cream and beat until the mixture is light and fluffy.",
        "Put a few raspberries in the bottom of each case, reserving some for garnish, then spoon the cream cheese mixture on top.",
        "Bake in the oven for 20-30 minutes, or until the cheesecake filling is set, but still slightly wobbly in the middle.",

        "To serve, carefully peel off the paper cases and top the cupcakes with a spoonful of whipped cream and a few raspberries. Sprinkle over the reserved biscuit mixture."
