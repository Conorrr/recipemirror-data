        "Place the egg yolk and tarragon vinegar reduction into a food processor and blend together until light and frothy.",
        "With the food processor still running on its slowest speed, add the melted butter, 1 tbsp at a time, until the sauce is thick and smooth. Be careful not to over beat the mixture as it may separate.",
