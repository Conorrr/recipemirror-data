        "Preheat the oven to 200C/400F/Gas 6.",
        "Roll the puff pastry out on a floured surface into an 15cmx25cm/6inx10in rectangle and spread all over with the cream cheese.",
        "Using a sharp knife, cut the pastry into 10 long, thin strips.",
        "Wrap one pastry strip in a spiral around each asparagus spear and place onto a baking tray. Lightly brush each with beaten egg then scatter over the parmesan.",
        "Bake the cigars in the oven for 15-20 minutes, or until the pastry has risen and is golden-brown."
