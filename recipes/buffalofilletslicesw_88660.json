        "For the buffalo slices, season the buffalo well with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Heat the oil in a frying pan and fry the buffalo for about two minutes on each side, or until cooked to your liking.",
        "For the quick hollandaise sauce, place the egg yolks, white wine vinegar, lemon zest and mustard into a jug. Gradually pour in the hot melted butter, blending the mixture as you go with a hand-blender until the sauce thickens and emulsifies. Stir in the juice of about half a lemon and season, to taste, with salt and freshly ground black pepper.",
        "To serve, place the bacon strips into a pan and fry until crisp.",
        "Place the buffalo slices onto a serving plate and top with the bacon. Drizzle over the hollandaise sauce and garnish with fresh chervil."
