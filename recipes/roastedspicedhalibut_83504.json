        "Heat the olive oil in an ovenproof frying pan over a high heat and add the halibut skin-side down to cook for one minute, until golden. Turn the halibut over and place in the oven to roast for 7-8 minutes, or until cooked through.",

        "Increase the heat and add the red wine. Boil the liquid to reduce by half, then add the stock and reduce the heat to simmer for 15 minutes, until the lentils are cooked through. Season, to taste, with salt and freshly ground black pepper.",
        "To serve, place a pile of the lentils into the middle of a warm plate and top with the spiced halibut."
