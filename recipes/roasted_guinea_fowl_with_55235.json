    "steps": [
        "Preheat the oven to 200C/180C Fan/Gas 6.",
        "For the guinea fowl, heat a large frying pan and add the oil and butter. Once hot, add the bird and sear all over.",
        "Put the guinea fowl in a roasting tray and transfer to the oven. Roast for 35-40 minutes until the juices run clear when a skewer is inserted into the thickest part of the thigh.",
        "Meanwhile, place the parsnips in a large saucepan and add the milk. Cook for 8-12 minutes. Drain the parsnips, reserving the milk. Put the parsnips in a blender and blend until smooth, gradually adding the milk, until you achieve a smooth pur\u00e9e.",
        "For the blackberry sauce, heat the butter in a saucepan over a medium heat. When the butter is foaming, add the shallot, garlic and thyme and fry for 2 minutes until softened. Add the remaining sauce ingredients, except the blackberries, and cook, stirring well, for 5-8 minutes until the sauce has thickened. Just before serving add the blackberries.",
        "For the cavolo nero, heat a saut\u00e9 pan and add the butter, once hot add the calvero nero and a little water. Cook until wilted.",
        "Remove the breasts from the guinea fowl. Divide the pur\u00e9e between 2 serving plates and top with the guinea fowl breasts. Place the cavolo nero on the side and spoon over the blackberry sauce. Garnish with cobnuts and serve."
