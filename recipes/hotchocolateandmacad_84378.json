        "Preheat oven to 200C/400F/Gas 6.",
        "Prepare a baking sheet by lining it with non-stick baking paper.",
        "For the spun sugar, heat the sugar and water in a clean saucepan over a medium heat, without stirring, until the sugar dissolves.",
        "Increase the heat and boil rapidly until the dissolved sugar thickens and darkens in colour.",
        "Carefully dip an oiled fork into the hot liquid sugar and flick it over an oiled wooden spoon to create fine strands of sugar. (NB: Cover the surrounding surfaces with newspaper beforehand as the sugar may scatter).",
        "For the chocolate glaze, place the cocoa and water into a bowl and combine to make a paste. Using a palette knife spread a thin layer onto a serving plate.",
        "Carve designs in the edge of the chocolate paste, with a fork while still slightly soft, then leave to set. Once set, use a pastry brush to glaze with honey.",
        "Place the vanilla tuille ingredients into a bowl and mix together. Using a knife, spread thin strips onto a piece of non-stick baking paper on the baking sheet, place into the oven and bake for five to eight minutes, until golden around edges. Remove immediately and carefully bend each tuille around a rolling pin to shape. Allow to cool.",
        "Grease the inside of two chefs' rings with butter and place on a greased baking sheet.",
        "For the fondant, place the flour, cornflour, caster sugar, egg yolk and chocolate into a food processor and blend until combined.",
        "Transfer the chocolate mixture into a bowl and gently fold in the egg whites and fill both greased chefs' rings.",
        "Arrange the macadamia nuts on top of each fondant, transfer onto a baking sheet and place into the oven to cook for 8-10mins, until golden and cooked on the outside but still runny in the centre.",
        "Carefully lift off the chefs' rings and cool slightly. Place onto the chocolate glazed plate.",
        "Arrange the bent vanilla tuille and spun sugar on top.",
        "To serve, decorate with a mint sprig."
