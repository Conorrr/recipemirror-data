        "For the figs, wrap each fig half in a slice of pancetta. Heat a frying pan, then add the figs and fry over a medium heat for 2-3 minutes on each side, or until the pancetta has turned golden-brown and crisp.",
        "For the salad, whisk the balsamic vinegar and olive oil in a bowl and combine. Season to taste with salt and freshly ground black pepper.",
        "Pour the dressing over the watercress and mix gently to coat the leaves.",
        "To serve, place the salad into the centre of a serving plate with the figs arranged around the edge, and drizzle over any remaining dressing."
