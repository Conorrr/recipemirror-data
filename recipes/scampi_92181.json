            "1 free-range egg, beaten",
            "800g/2lb monkfish tail, trimmed, cut into 7.5cm x 2.5cm/3in x 1in pieces",
            "vegetable oil, for frying"
        ],
        "For the dipping sauce": [
            "200g/7oz canned mushy peas",
            "1 tbsp ready-made mint sauce",
            "1 lime, juice only",
            "1 tbsp soured cream",
            "50ml/2fl oz water"

    "steps": [
        "Sprinkle the flour onto one plate and the breadcrumbs onto another. Beat the egg in a bowl.",
        "Dredge the monkfish pieces in the flour, then dip them into the beaten egg, then roll them in the breadcrumbs until completely coated.",
        "Heat about 0.5cm/\u00bcin of oil in a heavy-based frying pan over a high heat. When the oil is shimmering, add the monkfish pieces and fry, in batches, for 6-8 minutes, turning regularly, or until crisp and golden-brown on all sides. Remove from the pan using a slotted spoon and set aside to drain on kitchen paper. Repeat the process with the remaining monkfish pieces.",
        "Meanwhile, for the dipping sauce, in a bowl, mix together all of the dipping sauce ingredients in a bowl until smooth and well combined.",
        "To serve, divide the scampi equally among six small baskets or serving bowls. Spoon the dipping sauce into dipping bowls alongside."
