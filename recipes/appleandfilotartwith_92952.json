        "Preheat the oven to 220C/425F/Gas 7.",
        "For the apple and filo tart, place the apples, water and thyme leaves into a lidded saucepan, cover the pan with the lid and heat over a medium heat for 3-4 minutes, or until the apples have broken down into a pur\u00e9e. Stir in the butter and season, to taste, with salt and freshly ground black pepper.",
        "Place four of the filo pastry circles onto a baking tray. Brush each circle with some melted butter and place another filo pastry circle on top.",
        "Brush the uppermost with a little more butter and spoon the apple pur\u00e9e on top, ensuring all of the pastry is covered.",
        "Transfer to the oven and cook for 5-6 minutes, or until crisp and golden-brown.",
        "Meanwhile, brush the scallops with the olive oil and season, to taste, with salt.",
        "Heat a frying pan until hot. Add the scallops and fry on each side, for 45 seconds on each side, or until golden-brown on each side and cooked through. (NB: Do not move the scallops during cooking.) Remove the scallops from the pan and set aside to rest.",
        "For the bacon salad, heat a frying pan over a high heat until hot, add the bacon pieces and fry for 2-3 minutes, or until golden-brown and crisp.",
        "Whisk the mustard, vinegar and olive oil together in a bowl and season, to taste with a little salt and black pepper.",
        "Mix the salad leaves and fried bacon together in a bowl, then drizzle over the salad dressing and mix together until well combined.",
        "To serve, place an apple and filo tart onto each of four serving plates. Place three scallops onto each tart and top with a handful of bacon salad."
