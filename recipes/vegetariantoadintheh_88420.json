        "Preheat the oven to 240C/220 Fan/Gas 9.",
        "Heat the oil in a small frying pan and fry the sausages until browned on all sides, about 3-5 minutes.",
        "Put the flour in a bowl, season with salt and pepper and make a well in the centre. Crack in the egg and pour in the milk, then whisk until combined and free of lumps.",
        "Preheat a cupcake tray in the oven. When it is hot, drop the sausages into separate cupcake holes. Pour the batter around the sausages and bake for 15-18 minutes, or until golden-brown and risen.",
