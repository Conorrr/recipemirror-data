        "For the cheesecake, whisk the cream with an electric hand whisk until ribbons are left when you lift the whisk out of the cream. Fold in the mascarpone, sugar, flaked almonds and desiccated coconut and place into the fridge to chill.",
        "Meanwhile, for the base, combine the base ingredients in a bowl and mix well to break up the almonds slightly. Press into the base of two 10cm/4in chefs' rings.",
        "Remove the cheesecake mixture from the fridge and use to almost fill the chefs' rings, leaving a 1cm/\u00bdin gap at the top.",
        "For the mango topping, mix together the mango, honey and chilli in a bowl and spoon on top of the cheesecakes. Level off the tops with a palette knife and chill in the fridge for ten minutes.",
        "To serve, remove the cheesecakes from the fridge. Holding the outside of the rings with a hot cloth, place the cheesecakes onto serving plates and slide off the rings."
