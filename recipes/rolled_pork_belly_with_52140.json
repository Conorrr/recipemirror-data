        "For the rolled pork belly, preheat the oven to 230C/445F/Gas 8.",
        "Put the pork in a large baking tray. Rub it with the salt and thyme and season with pepper.",

        "For the wilted kale and heritage carrots, put the carrots in a deep frying pan with the sugar and 400ml/14fl oz water and cook for 6-8 minutes, or until tender.",
        "Heat the butter in a frying pan and once melted add the kale with two tablespoons of water and cook until wilted.",
        "Once the meat has rested carve it into 2cm/1in thick slices.",
        "Place the apple sauce on the plates with the kale on top. Put the pork on top of that and lay the carrots alongside. Drizzle the gravy over and around the plate."
