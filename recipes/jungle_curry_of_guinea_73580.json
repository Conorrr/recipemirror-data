        "To make the curry paste, wrap the shrimp paste in a foil parcel and toast in a dry hot frying pan or directly on a gas burner until fragrant.",

        "For the curry, in a large wok, heat the vegetable oil until hot. Add the curry paste and green cardamons and cook to a dry paste. Add the guinea fowl joints and fry for a few minutes. Add the krachai, the lime leaves, fish sauce, Shaoxing wine and chicken stock. Cook until the guinea fowl is cooked through. This will take around 30 minutes. Taste and add caster sugar to taste.",
        "Meanwhile, cook the rice. Wash the rice three times and leave to sit for 10 minutes. Place all the ingredients for the rice into a pot and cover with water. Place a lid on, bring to the boil and cook for four minutes and turn off and allow to stand covered for 12 minutes, or until cooked to your liking.",
        "Garnish the finished dish with snake beans, bamboo shoots, lime leaves and sliced red chilli."
