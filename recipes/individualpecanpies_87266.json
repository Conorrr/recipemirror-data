    "steps": [
        "Preheat the oven to 190C/375F/Gas 5.",
        "Line six individual tart cases with the sweet pastry and chill for 30 minutes.",
        "Place the pastry-lined tart cases onto a baking sheet. Line each one with baking parchment then add baking beans or uncooked rice. Place in the oven and bake blind for 15 minutes.",
        "Remove from the oven and carefully remove the baking parchment and baking beans or rice. Return the tarts to the oven for a further five minutes or until golden-brown.",
        "Meanwhile, crack the eggs into a bowl and whisk.",
        "Add a pinch of salt, melted butter, golden syrup, muscovado sugar and vanilla extract and whisk together until thoroughly combined and smooth.",
        "Pour this mixture into the pastry cases, filling to just below the rim of the pastry.",
        "Divide the pecan halves evenly among each tart, arranging them in a circular pattern on top of each one.",
        "Place in the oven and bake for 10-12 minutes until the filling is just set.",
        "Remove and leave to cool for ten minutes.",
        "Serve on individual serving plates with a scoop of vanilla ice cream alongside."
