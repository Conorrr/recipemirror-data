    "steps": [
        "Pre-heat the oven to 220C/425F/Gas 7. Line a baking tray with parchment paper.",
        "Place both flours, baking powder, salt, cheddar and half the parmesan into a large bowl and mix to combine. Add the milk and bring the ingredients together with your hands or a wooden spoon. The mixture will be sticky at this point.",
        "Tip the mixture onto a lightly floured surface. Fold and knead to form a soft dough.",
        "Flatten or lightly roll the dough to 2.5cm/1in thick. Dredge a 6cm/2\u00bdin cutter in flour to ensure a precise cut and cut out 15 scones. Place them onto the baking tray \u2013 you may need to do this in two batches. Brush the tops of the scones with the beaten egg and sprinkle with the remaining parmesan.",
        "Cook for 15-17 minutes until the scones are risen and golden-brown. Serve warm with butter."
