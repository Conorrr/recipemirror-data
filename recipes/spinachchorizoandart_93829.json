        "Place the dough into a lightly greased bowl, cover with cling film and leave to rise in a warm place for one hour.",
        "Remove the dough from the bowl and knead for a minute on a floured work surface, then divide into four pieces and roll each into a circle 0.5cm/\u00bcin thick.",
        "For the topping, heat a frying pan until hot, and then add the oil, shallots and garlic and fry for 3-4 minutes.",
        "Add the tomatoes, sugar and the chopped basil and bring to the boil. Reduce the heat and simmer for 20 minutes, or until the sauce has thickened. Season, to taste, with salt and freshly ground black pepper and leave to cool.",

        "For the salad, place the spinach and gem lettuce leaves in a large bowl, with the cherry tomatoes.",

        "To serve, place each pizza on a warm plate with the salad on the side."
