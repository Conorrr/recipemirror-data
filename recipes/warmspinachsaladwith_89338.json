        "Preheat the oven to 180C/350F/Gas 4.",
        "Heat two tablespoons of the oil in a frying pan over a medium heat. Add the sweet potato cubes and fry for about 3-4 minutes, or until they start to colour.",
        "Add the tomato halves to the pan, stir to coat in the oil, season well with salt and freshly ground black pepper, and transfer to the oven. Cook for 7-10 minutes.",
        "Heat two tablespoons more of the oil in the frying pan over a gentle heat. Add the spinach and cook for 1-2 minutes until wilted.",
        "Drizzle one tablespoon of the vinegar over the cooked spinach and stir.",
        "Put the remaining vinegar and oil into a separate, non-reactive pan over a medium heat. Add the kidney beans and cook for 2-3 minutes until warmed through.",
        "To serve, place the wilted spinach in the centre of a serving plate and arrange the roasted tomato halves and sweet potato cubes on top. Spoon the kidney beans and balsamic sauce around the edge."
