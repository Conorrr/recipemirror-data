        "For the paneer, half fill a deep, heavy based saucepan or deep fat fryer with the vegetable oil and heat until a small cube of bread sizzles and turns golden when dropped into it. (CAUTION: hot oil can be dangerous. Do not leave unattended.)",
        "Place the plain flour, beaten egg and finely chopped pine nuts into three separate bowls. First roll the paneer in the plain flour, then in the egg and finally in the pine nuts.",
        "Carefully place the paneer into the hot oil and cook until golden-brown, then carefully remove with a slotted spoon and drain on kitchen paper.",
        "For the dressing, heat the oil in a saucepan over a medium heat, then add the red pepper and garlic to the pan and cook for three minutes. Remove from the heat and add the orange juice and honey and season to taste with salt and freshly ground black pepper.",
        "Transfer the dressing to a mini-blender and blend until smooth, then pour into a small dipping bowl to serve.",
        "For the spinach salad, combine all of the ingredients in a mixing bowl.",
        "To serve, place the salad onto a large plate with the paneer on top and the small dipping bowl of sauce alongside."
