        "For the dressing, heat the oil in a saucepan over a medium heat, then add the red pepper and garlic to the pan and cook for three minutes. Remove from the heat and add the orange juice and honey and season to taste with salt and freshly ground black pepper.",
        "Transfer the dressing to a mini-blender and blend until smooth, then pour into a small dipping bowl to serve.",
        "For the spinach salad, combine all of the ingredients in a mixing bowl.",
        "To serve, place the salad onto a large plate with the paneer on top and the small dipping bowl of sauce alongside."
