        "For the sauce": [
            "25g/1oz unsalted butter",
            "25g/1oz plain flour",
            "300ml whole milk",
            "splash dry sherry",
            "75g/2\u00bdoz cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche",
            "1 tbsp Dijon mustard",
            "1 red chilli, finely chopped",
            "75g/2\u00bdoz gruy\u00e8re cheese",

    "steps": [
        "Kill the lobsters by first placing them in the freezer for half an hour, then piercing each one between the eyes with a sharp knife.",
        "Bring a large pan of salted water to the boil. Place the lobster into the pan. Bring back to the boil and cook for 6-8 minutes.",
        "Remove the lobster from the water and allow to cool. When cool enough to handle use a large sharp knife to cut it in half lengthways.",
        "Use a spoon to scoop out all of the body meat out carefully. Crack the claws with your knife and carefully remove the flesh.",
        "Cut the lobster flesh into large chunks and set aside.",
        "For the sauce, melt the 25g butter in a pan, then stir in the flour and cook for one minute.",
        "Add the milk and stir over a low heat to bring slowly to the boil. Reduce the heat and simmer for ten minutes.",
        "Add the sherry, cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche and mustard and stir well.",
        "Add the chilli and half of the gruy\u00e8re and stir well, until the cheese has melted. Season, to taste, with salt and freshly ground black pepper.",
        "Meanwhile, to finish the lobster, heat the 45g of butter in a frying pan. Once the butter is foaming add the reserved lobster meat and fry to heat through for 1-2 minutes.",
        "Heat the grill to its highest setting.",
        "Place the halved lobster shells onto a baking tray. Spoon a little of the sauce into each shell, then add the lobster flesh. Pour over the rest of the sauce and top with the remaining gruy\u00e8re.",
        "Place the lobster halves under the grill and cook until the topping is bubbling and golden-brown.",
        "To serve, place a lobster half onto each plate and sprinkle with chopped parsley."
