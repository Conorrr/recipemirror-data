    "description": "This recipe will take some organising (prawns are steamed through \u2018apple vapour\u2019 pushed through a home espresso machine). But there\u2019s no doubt that you\u2019ll have something interesting to talk about over dinner. Equipment and preparation: you will need a piece of clean cheesecloth or muslin, a sheet of clean cut glass and a home espresso machine.",
