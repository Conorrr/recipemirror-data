        "Clean the mussels by thoroughly scrubbing them under plenty of running water, pulling away and discarding the 'beards', the seaweed-like stringy threads. Discard any broken mussels, and any mussels that don't close tightly when you tap them.",
        "Place the mussels in a saucepan, add the white wine and cook for 3-4 minutes.",
        "Drain, reserving the cooking liquor, and pick the mussels from their shells. Set aside the liquor and the mussels, but discard the shells.",
        "Heat a large frying pan and add the oil. Add the finely chopped shallot, garlic and fennel and cook for 3-4 minutes.",
        "Add the saffron, aniseed liqueur, stock, three-quarters of the mussel meat, finish with the cream",
        "Cook for a further 3-4 minutes until warmed through, then blend with a stick blender until smooth.",
        "Heat a large griddle pan and drizzle the sliced bread with oil and rub with the halved clove of garlic. Toast the bread on the griddle for 2-3 minutes."
