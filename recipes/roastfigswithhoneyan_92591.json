        "Preheat the oven to 200C/400F/Gas 6.",
        "Cut a deep cross down into each fig, nearly to the bottom, then squeeze the sides of each fig to expose the juicy flesh. Place the figs into a lidded baking dish.",
        "Drizzle over the honey and Marsala wine, ensuring some runs down inside the figs. Cover with the lid and bake in the oven for about 20 minutes.",
        "Serve the figs immediately with ice cream and the boozy syrup from the baking dish. Alternatively, serve with cream, custard or mascarpone."
