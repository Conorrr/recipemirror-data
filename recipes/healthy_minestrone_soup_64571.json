        "Tip 1: This soup is ideal for using up any odds and ends of pasta \u2013 just place it all in a food bag and bash with a rolling pin until roughly the same size. Tip 2: You can use this recipe as a base for any soup - vegetables that are in season are usually the cheapest and tastiest. Tip 3: A bouquet garni is a bunch of fresh herbs \u2013 1 sprig of rosemary, 1 fresh bay leaf, and 1 sprig of thyme, tied together with cooking string. It can be bought ready-made. Tip 4: Make up a big batch of soup, even if you\u2019re only cooking for yourself \u2013 the rest can be chilled in the fridge or frozen in portions for future meals."
