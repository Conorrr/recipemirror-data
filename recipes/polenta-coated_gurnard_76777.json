        "For the gurnard, fill a deep-fat fryer or a large, deep, heavy-bottomed pan two-thirds full with sunflower oil. Heat to 180C. (To check the oil is at the right temperature, drop a cube of bread into the hot oil. It should become golden-brown in 1 minute.) (CAUTION: Hot oil can be dangerous. Don't leave unattended.)",
        "Place the flour, egg and polenta in three dishes and dip the fish through the three dishes in that order to coat it in flour, egg and polenta.",
        "Carefully lower the fish into the fat and fry for 4-6 minutes, then remove and drain on kitchen paper.",
        "To make the relish, put all the ingredients in a large bowl, season with salt and pepper, mix and set aside.",
        "For the jalape\u00f1o mayonnaise, put the egg yolks into a food processor and start to blend. Gradually add the oil in a thin stream until you have the consistency of mayonnaise.",
        "Remove the mayonnaise from the food processor and place in a large bowl. Add the remaining ingredients and mix to combine.",
        "To serve, place the fried fish on serving plates with the relish and jalape\u00f1o mayonnaise alongside. Garnish with the lime halves and fresh coriander leaves."
