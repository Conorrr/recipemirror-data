        "Preheat the oven to 180C/350F/Gas 4. Line a 6-hole muffin tray with paper cases.",
        "In a large mixing bowl, beat together the egg, oil and orange juice until well combined. Stir in the grated beetroot.",
        "In a separate mixing bowl, mix together the flour, baking powder, sugar, sunflower seeds and mixed spice until well combined.",
        "Add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients one tablespoon at a time, mixing well after each addition.",
        "Divide the muffin mixture equally among the six muffin cases. Bake in the oven for 20-25 minutes, or until the muffins are cooked through (a skewer inserted into the centre should come out clean). Set aside to cool, then serve."
