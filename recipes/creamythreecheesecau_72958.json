            "1 cauliflower, trimmed and cut into 1cm/0.5in pieces",

            "1 tsp Dijon mustard",
            "4oz/125g blue cheese, crumbled",
            "1oz/25g walnuts, roughly chopped",

        "Bring 5cm/2in depth of water to the boil in a saucepan, add the cauliflower and cook for about 8 minutes, or until tender. Drain, and return the cauliflower to the pan.",
        "Mix the cream cheese and mustard with the cauliflower, then stir in the blue cheese. Season with a little salt if necessary and plenty of pepper.",
        "Pour the mixture into a shallow gratin dish. Scatter the walnuts on top, then cover with the cheddar (this helps to prevent the walnuts from burning). Place under a preheated hot grill for 10-15 minutes, or until the top is golden brown and the inside hot and bubbling.",
        "Serve at once with a watercress salad."
