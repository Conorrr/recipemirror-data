        "For the lamb dopiaza, heat the oil in a frying pan over a medium heat and cook the onion until soft. Add the lamb and fry for 3-4 minutes.",
        "Add the tomato, curry powder and yoghurt, stir well and bring to a simmer, then set aside to keep warm.",
        "For the pancake, place the flour, egg and milk into a large bowl and whisk together to form a batter the consistency of double cream.",
        "Heat the vegetable oil in a frying pan over a medium heat and wipe out the excess with kitchen paper.",
        "Place a large spoonful of the pancake batter into the pan and swirl to coat the base of the pan. Cook until the base is golden-brown, then flip or turn over using a fish slice and cook on the other side.",
        "For the salsa, place all the salsa ingredients (not the yoghurt) into a bowl, season with salt and freshly ground black pepper and mix well.",
        "To serve, place the pancake onto a serving plate, fill with the lamb dopiaza and roll up like a cigar. Top with the salsa and a dollop of yoghurt."
