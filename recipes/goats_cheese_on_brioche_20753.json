        "For the dressing, place the redcurrant jelly, vinegar and cloves into a saucepan and cook until reduced in volume down to a glaze thick enough to coat the back of a spoon.",

        "For the salad, preheat the oven to 200C/400F/Gas 6.",
        "Whisk the egg whites until soft peaks then fold in the salt.",
        "Place a spoonful onto a baking tray then place the celeriac on top and cover with the rest of the salt.",
        "Place in the oven and bake for 45 minutes then leave to rest for five minutes.",
        "Crack the egg coating and remove the celeriac, discarding the salt.",
