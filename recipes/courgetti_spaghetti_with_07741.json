        "For the pesto, blend all of the ingredients and 9 tablespoons water to a rough paste in a food processor. Add extra water to loosen the mixture if necessary. Season with salt and pepper. Set aside.",
        "For the courgetti spaghetti, peel spaghetti-like strands from the courgettes using a julienne peeler, collecting them in a large mixing bowl.",
        "Scrape the pesto on top of the courgette strands and carefully stir until the courgette is evenly coated.",
        "To serve, pile the courgetti spaghetti and pesto onto serving plates and top with the chopped avocado, reserved basil leaves, chopped chilli and a drizzle of extra virgin olive oil."
    ],
    "tips": [
        "Tip 1: Cover any leftover pesto with oil, then store in the fridge for up to 1 week. Tip 2: Add an extra 1 tbsp of water to the pesto mixture if using sun-dried tomatoes that are not in oil. Tip 3: If you don\u2019t have a julienne peeler, use a normal vegetable peeler to slice the courgette lengthways into very wide ribbons, then julienne these using a knife."
