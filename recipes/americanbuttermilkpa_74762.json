        "Mix the buttermilk, egg and melted butter in a large bowl, until smooth and blended. Sift together the tapioca flour, fine cornmeal, salt and bicarbonate of soda and gently stir into the buttermilk only until the ingredients are moistened - don't worry about the lumps.",
        "Heat a heavy iron or non-stick pan until medium hot. Grease with a little clarified butter. Spoon one generous tablespoon of batter onto the pan and spread slightly with the back of the spoon.",
        "Cook until the bubbles rise and break on the top of the pancake. Flip over gently. Cook until pale golden on the other side. Remove and keep warm. Continue until all the batter has been used.",
        "Spread each pancake with butter and serve a stack of three per person with crispy bacon and maple syrup."
