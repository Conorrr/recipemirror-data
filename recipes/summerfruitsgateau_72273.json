        "Line a 18cm/7in baking tin or springform tin with a little oil and cling film.",
        "Cut out the centre of both flans using a 20-25cm/8-10in springform tin base as a guide.",
        "Line the bottom of the tin with one of the circles, and reserve the other.",
        "Whip the double cream with the sugar and brandy until thick, and put in the fridge.",
        "Cut the ladyfinger biscuits in half. Line the ring with the ladyfinger halves so that they form an attractive exterior.",
        "Spoon the fruit compote in the bottom of the flan in an even layer.",
        "Spoon the chilled, whipped cream into the ring and gently press to the edges, ensuring that you keep the biscuits in place.",
        "Scatter over the raspberries.",
        "Add the other sponge disc and press it down gently.",
        "Put a plate over the bottom of the tin and, carefully, turn the tin over.",
        "Gently remove the springform tin but keep the cling film in place. Put the cake into the fridge and let it set for at least one hour.",
        "Remove from the fridge and take off the cling film. Dust with icing sugar, garnish with fresh fruits and serve."
