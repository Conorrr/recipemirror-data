        "Push the cumin and caraway seeds into the dough and knead the dough until the seeds are incorporated.",
        "Divide the dough into 2 or 3.",

        "Heat a frying pan to a medium heat and add a splash of olive oil. Shallow fry each dough disc until browned on both sides, then set aside to cool slightly before serving."
