        "Bring a large pan of salted water to the boil and cook the spaghetti for 8 minutes, until al dente.",

        "Add the garlic, chilli and almonds and stir-fry for a further 3 minutes. Season with salt and pepper.",
        "Drain the spaghetti and add to the broccoli pan, stir well to combine and serve."
