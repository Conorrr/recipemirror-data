    "steps": [
        "For the romesco salad, preheat the oven to 200C/400F/Gas 6.",
        "Place the peppers onto a baking tray and roast for 30-35 minutes, or until the peppers are blackened.",
        "Remove from the oven and place in a plastic sandwich bag. Set aside to steam for five minutes.",
        "Heat the oil in a frying pan and cook the ciabatta for 2-3 minutes, turning frequently, or until crisp all over.",
        "Carefully peel the peppers to remove all the skin. Place the peppers, ciabatta, tomatoes, almonds and garlic in a large bowl and set aside.",
        "For the dressing, whisk the olive oil, vinegar, basil, smoked paprika and cayenne pepper together in a small bowl.",
        "For the griddled lemon and parsley tuna, place the tuna steaks in a medium bowl with the olive oil, lemon zest and juice and parsley.",
        "Heat a griddle pan, add the tuna steaks and fry on each side for 2-3 minutes, or until cooked to your liking.",
        "To serve, pour the dressing over the romesco salad and stir until well combined. Spoon the salad onto each of four serving plates and and serve the tuna alongside."
