        "For the toppings, add the oil to the pan and fry the bacon until crisp. Remove from the pan and set aside.",

        "Place the mushrooms into the pan and saut\u00e9 for 3-4 minutes.",
        "For the saut\u00e9ed potatoes, heat the olive oil in a frying pan and saut\u00e9 the potato cubes for five minutes, stirring occasionally. Add the rosemary and garlic and fry for a further minute.",
        "To serve, place one slice of toasted ciabatta onto a serving plate and top with the burger, the mushrooms and the cheese. Using a mini-blowtorch, heat the cheese until slightly melted. Top with the bacon, followed by the other slice of toasted ciabatta. Scatter the fried onions and saut\u00e9ed potatoes around the plate."
