    "steps": [
        "To make the marinade, spoon the honey and oyster sauce into a roasting tin or baking dish. Add the chilli flakes, star anise and salt. Grind the peppercorns and add them to the marinade.",
        "Toss the ribs in the marinade and tuck the garlic cloves whole between the ribs, then set aside for at least 2 hours. It wouldn\u2019t hurt if they stay there overnight.",
        "Roast the ribs at 160C/325F/Gas 3 for 90 minutes, turning them in their sauce from time to time.",
        "Then turn the heat up to 200C for 15 minutes, Keep an eye on them, as sometimes they burn easily. They are ready when the meat is tender, though far from falling off the bone, and the ribs are sticky and almost charred."
