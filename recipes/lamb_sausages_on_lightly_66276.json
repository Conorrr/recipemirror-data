        "Heat the oil in a large frying pan and cook the sausages, turning regularly, for 15-20 minutes, or until cooked through.",
        "Meanwhile, in a bowl, mix the cabbage with the salt. Bring a large pan of water to the boil, then plunge the cabbage into the water for 30 seconds. Drain the cabbage, then put it in a large bowl of cold water. Drain again and set aside.",
        "Melt the butter in a large saut\u00e9 pan and fry the bacon until lightly browned. Lower the heat and add the shallot. Add the drained cabbage and vinegar and cook for three minutes, or until done to your liking. Season to taste with salt and pepper.",
        "Serve the sausages with the cabbage and new potatoes, garnished with the chopped parsley."
