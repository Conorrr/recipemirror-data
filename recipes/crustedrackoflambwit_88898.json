        "Preheat the oven to 180C/350F/Gas 4.",
        "For the lamb, season the lamb with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Heat a dry ovenproof frying pan then add the lamb rack, skin-side down. Sear the meat on all sides then transfer to the oven to cook for 8-10 minutes.",
        "Meanwhile, place the breadcrumbs, chives, parsley, pine nuts and oil into a food processor and pulse until smooth.",
        "Remove the lamb from the oven and press the crust mixture onto the outside of the rack. Return to the oven for 3-5 minutes, or until the crust is golden-brown and the lamb is cooked to your liking.",
        "For the red wine jus, heat the wine in a small frying pan over a medium heat. Crumble in the beef stock cube and add the tomato pur\u00e9e. Bring to the boil and reduce for 4-5 minutes.",
        "Remove from the heat, add the butter and stir to create a glossy sauce.",
        "For the chargrilled carrots, heat a griddle pan until hot, then add the carrots and oil and cook for 8-10 minutes, turning occasionally, until the carrots are tender and cooked through.",
        "To serve, cut the lamb into separate cutlets and place onto a plate. Place the carrots alongside and spoon the red wine jus around the edge of the plate."
