        "Meanwhile, for the salmon crisps, place the vegetable oil into a deep, heavy-bottomed saucepan and heat until a small cube of bread sizzles and turns golden when dropped into it. (CAUTION: hot oil can be dangerous. Do not leave unattended.)",
        "Carefully place the salmon skin strips into the hot oil and deep fry until golden-brown and crisp. Remove from the oil with a slotted spoon and drain on kitchen paper.",
