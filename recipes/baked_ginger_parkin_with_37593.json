        "Preheat the oven to 140C/275F/Gas 1 and butter a 30cm/12in x 20cm/8in cake tin.",
        "For the parkin, put the soft brown sugar, butter, syrup and treacle into a small saucepan and melt over a gentle heat.",
        "Put the oats, flour, ginger, nutmeg, mixed spice and a pinch of salt into a large bowl, then add the eggs and milk. Pour the melted butter and sugar mixture into the bowl and mix together with a whisk until combined.",
        "Pour into the prepared tin and bake for 1\u00bc hours, or until firm in the centre.",
        "Remove from the oven and leave in the tin to cool before turning out and cutting into squares. This is best kept kept in a tin for 2-3 days as it will become really sticky all the way through.",
        "For the rhubarb, put the butter, sugar and five tablespoons of water in a large frying pan with the orange zest and rhubarb. Place over a gentle heat to poach for 4-5 minutes, or until just tender, then remove from the heat.",
        "For the syrup, combine the golden syrup, cider and spices in a saucepan and bring to the boil. Reduce the heat and cook for 3-4 minutes, or until just thickened.",
        "Serve the parkin in squares with a spoonful of rhubarb to one side and the syrup over the top. Finish with a scoop of ice cream."
