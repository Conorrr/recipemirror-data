    "steps": [
        "Preheat the oven to 180C/350F/Gas 4.",

        "Fry the onion and garlic in the remaining oil for 3-4 minutes, or until soft.",
        "Place the chorizo, onion, garlic, rice, tomatoes, butter and parsley into a well-buttered casserole dish. Season with salt and freshly ground black pepper.",
        "Pour over the chicken stock, cover with a tight-fitting lid and bake in the oven for about 25-30 minutes, or until the rice is cooked.",
        "Meanwhile, wrap each salmon fillet in smoked salmon and trim off any excess flesh. Season with salt and freshly ground black pepper and squeeze over with the lemon juice.",
        "Roast the salmon pieces in the oven for 6-8 minutes, or until cooked through.",
        "Serve the salmon on top of the chorizo rice."

    "tips": [
        "To make this recipe even easier, just use plain salmon fillets without the smoked salmon."
