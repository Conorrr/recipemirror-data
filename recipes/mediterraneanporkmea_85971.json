    "steps": [
        "For the tomato sauce, heat the oil in a large pan over a low heat. Add the onion, celery and garlic and fry until softened, but not coloured.",
        "Add the tomato pur\u00e9e and cook for a few minutes, then add the canned tomatoes, cinnamon, stock and wine.",
        "Season, to taste, with salt and freshly ground black pepper and bring to the boil, then turn the heat down very low.",
        "Half-cover the pan with a lid and leave the sauce to simmer for one hour, stirring occasionally.",
        "If you want a smooth sauce, transfer to a food processor and blend the sauce, then pass it through a fine sieve before using. Otherwise use as it is.",
        "Meanwhile, for the meatballs, heat the oil in a frying pan over a medium heat.",
        "Add the onion and the garlic and fry until softened. Remove from the heat and allow to cool slightly.",
        "Preheat the grill to its highest setting.",
        "Place the pork mince, basil and cinnamon into a bowl and add the cooked onion and garlic. Season generously with salt and freshly ground black pepper and mix well.",
        "Roll small amounts of the mince mixture into balls. This quantity of mixture should make 12-16 meatballs, depending on size.",
        "Brush the meatballs with a little oil and place onto a baking tray.",
        "Place under the grill to cook for 6-8 minutes, turning occasionally and brushing them with a little oil as they brown.",
        "To serve, stir the cooked spaghetti through the sauce and place onto plates with three or four meatballs placed on top."
