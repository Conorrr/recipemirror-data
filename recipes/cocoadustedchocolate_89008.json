        "Place a heatproof glass bowl over a pan of boiling water, taking care not to let the bottom of the bowl touch the water surface. Break the chocolate into pieces and place into the bowl, and leave for 2-3 minutes, stirring occasionally until the chocolate is completely melted.",
        "Dip the strawberries in the melted chocolate and then lay on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Place in the fridge for at least 15 minutes to harden the chocolate.",
        "To serve, transfer the chocolate-dipped strawberries onto a serving plate and dust with the cocoa powder."
