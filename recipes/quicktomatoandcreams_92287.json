        "Heat a good glug of olive oil in a pan with a few handfuls of mixed tomatoes, cutting up the larger ones roughly. Add a couple of chopped garlic cloves and a quite finely chopped rosemary sprig or two and cook until the tomatoes are squashy. Pour in a bit of double cream at the end, season with salt and freshly ground black pepper and serve on the side of meat, or eat with rice or pasta."
