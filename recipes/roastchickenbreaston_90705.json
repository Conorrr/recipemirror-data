        "Heat the olive oil in a frying pan and fry the chicken for 1-2 minutes on both sides, or until golden-brown.",

        "Place the potato slices into a baking tray and lay the chicken on top, skin-side up. Sprinkle over the thyme leaves, garlic and onion and season well with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Drizzle over the olive oil and place into the oven to roast for 4-5 minutes, then pour the wine into the pan and return to the oven to roast for a further 5-6 minutes, or until the chicken is golden-brown and cooked through.",
