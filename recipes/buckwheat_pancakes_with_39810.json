            "400ml/14fl oz dairy-free milk or apple juice",

            "40g/1\u00bdoz gram flour",
            "1 tbsp cornflour",
            "pinch salt",
            "200g/7oz soya or regular cream cheese",
            "1 lemon, juice and zest",
            "rapeseed oil, for frying",
            "200g/7oz smoked salmon",
            "small bunch of chives, chopped",
            "25g/1oz pumpkin seeds, toasted",
            "1 tbsp caperberries, roughly chopped"

    "steps": [
        "Whisk together the dairy-free milk, flours, salt and 65ml/2\u00bcfl oz water in a large bowl. Leave the mixture to rest for at least 1 hour.",
        "Meanwhile, mix the cream cheese, lemon juice and lemon zest together in a bowl. Beat until smooth and creamy then store in the fridge until ready to use.",
        "Heat a 20-25cm/8-10in non-stick frying pan over a medium heat until hot. Brush lightly with oil and pour in a little of the batter, swirling it around so that it forms a thin layer on the bottom of the pan. If the batter isn\u2019t thin enough you can add a little more liquid to the mixture.",
        "When the top of the pancake is dry (about 1 minute) flip the pancake and cook the other side for a further minute, the pancakes should colour just slightly. Repeat with the remaining batter. You can keep the cooked pancakes warm by wrapping in foil and placing in a low temperature oven.",
        "Spread a generous layer of cream cheese over the pancake and top with a slice of smoked salmon, chives, pumpkin seeds and caperberries. Roll the pancake to enclose the filling and serve."
