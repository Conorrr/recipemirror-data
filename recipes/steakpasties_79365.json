        "Preheat the oven to 200C/400F/Gas 6.",
        "Place the steak, paprika, chilli flakes, garlic, lime and salt into the food processor and blend to a smooth mince paste.",
        "Using a large pastry cutter or a knife and a small plate as a guide, cut rounds in the filo pastry.",
        "Place some of the mince mixture onto one half of each round. Brush the edge of the pastry with melted butter and fold over the other side of the pastry to seal into a pasty shape. Use a fork to decorate the sealed edge and brush the pastry with melted butter.",
        "Place onto a greased baking sheet and place in the oven to bake for 5-8 minutes, or until golden and cooked through."
