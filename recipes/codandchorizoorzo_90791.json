Heat an ovenproof frying pan until smoking, add one tablespoon of the olive oil and fry the cod for 1-2 minutes on both sides, or until golden-brown all over. Transfer to the oven to cook for 3-4 minutes, or until the fish is cooked through.",
        "Remove the fish from the pan and flake the flesh onto a plate.",

        "Add the cooked orzo and smoked sweet paprika to the pan, stir well to coat in the oil and cook for 1-2 minutes. Return the chorizo to the pan and add the roasted red peppers and flaked cod. Mix well to combine and season with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Stir in the parsley and lemon juice.",
