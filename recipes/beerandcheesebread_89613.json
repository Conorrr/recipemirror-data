        "In a bowl dissolve the sugar and yeast in the brown ale and set aside for 5-6 minutes.",
        "Mix the bread flour, the wholemeal flour, cheddar, parmesan, powdered milk, salt, mustard powder, eggs and fennel seeds in a large mixing bowl. Add the yeast and beer mixture and mix well with your hands until the mixture forms a soft dough.",
        "Using floured hands, knead the dough on a clean, floured work surface for 20-25 minutes until smooth and elastic. If the dough becomes too dry add a little warm water.",
        "Divide the dough into two loaves and place them onto a large baking tray. Using a sharp knife, score the top of the loaves with a criss-cross pattern. Cover with a clean damp tea towel and leave for two hours in a warm, dry and draught-free place, until the dough has risen and doubled in size.",
        "Preheat the oven to 200C/400F/Gas 6. When the loaves have expanded, brush each with the egg white.",
        "Transfer the loaves to the oven and bake for 25-30 minutes, or until the bread has cooked through and the crust is golden-brown.",
        "To serve, slice the loaves and serve with a big bowl of soup."
