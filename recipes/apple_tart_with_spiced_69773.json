        "Preheat the oven to 210C/425F/Gas 7.",
        "On a lightly floured work surface, roll out the puff pastry to 3-4mm/\u215bin thick. Cut out four 12cm/4\u00bdin circles using a pastry cutter and transfer to a baking tray.",
        "Score a circle in the centre of the pastry with a knife (leaving a 1cm/\u00bdin border) then brush with egg wash.",
        "Roll the marzipan out to 5mm/\u00bcin thick and cut into four 11cm/4\u00bcin circles and place in the centre of the pastry. Carefully place the apples in an overlapping ring over the marzipan to cover it all.",
        "Place the butter and honey in a small saucepan and bring to a simmer, stirring to combine. Brush most of it over the top of the apples.",
        "Place in the oven and bake for 15-18 minutes, or until the pastry is risen and golden-brown.",
        "Brush with any remaining melted butter and honey to glaze.",
        "For the spiced caramel sauce, place the sugar and spices in a frying pan and cook until the sugar is melted and golden-brown. Whisk in the double cream and bring to a simmer.",
        "Cook for 3-5 minutes, or until just thickened, then pass through a fine sieve into a clean pan.",
        "To serve, place the tarts in the centre of serving plates and spoon the sauce around the edge. Finish with a spoonful of ice cream on top."
