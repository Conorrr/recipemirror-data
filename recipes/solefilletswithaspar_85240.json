        "For the sole, place the sole fillets onto a clean board and season well with salt and freshly ground black pepper.",
        "Place the carrot, pepper and asparagus in a saucepan of boiling water and blanch for 1-2 minutes, then drain.",
        "Place a mixture of the blanched vegetables at one end of each fillet. Roll up the fillet to enclose the vegetables and secure the roll with a cocktail stick.",
        "Squeeze over lemon juice and place the sole rolls into a steamer and steam for 4-6 minutes, until the sole is cooked through.",
        "For the cheats' b\u00e9arnaise sauce, place the egg yolks into a clean food processor bowl and blend together for one minute.",
        "With the food processor still running, slowly pour the vinegar into the egg, followed by the butter, again, pouring in gradually.",
        "Add the tarragon and season, to taste, with salt and freshly ground black pepper.",
