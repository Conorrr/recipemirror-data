        "Remove and brush over a little of the maple syrup.",
        "To cook the pancakes, preheat a non-stick frying pan. Add a little butter and pour around three spoonfuls of the mixture into the pan - the pancakes should be quite small. Cook until golden brown and turn over to colour the other side. Remove and place on a large plate.",
