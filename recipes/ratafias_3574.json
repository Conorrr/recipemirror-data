        "Blanch, skin and dry the almonds, and pound them in a mortar with the white of an egg.",
        "Stir in the sugar, and gradually add the remaining egg whites, taking care that they are very thoroughly whisked.",
        "Drop the mixture through a small biscuit syringe, on to cartridge-paper, and bake the cakes from 10-12 minutes in rather a hot oven.",
        "A very small quantity should be dropped on the paper to form one cake, as the mixture spreads; when baked, the ratafias should be about the size of a large button."
