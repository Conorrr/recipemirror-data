        "For the marinated lamb chops, pour three tablespoons of olive oil into a deep dish or tray and add the sliced garlic.",
        "Rub the thyme and rosemary between your hands to help release the herbs' aromatic oils, before placing into the oiled dish.",
        "Place the lamb chops on top of the herbs and garlic before covering with the remaining tablespoon of olive oil. Cover and place into a fridge to marinate overnight.",
        "For the garlic butter, mix the butter and crushed garlic in a bowl with the parsley.",
        "For the field mushrooms, spoon the garlic butter mix into the underside of the mushrooms. Season with salt and freshly ground black pepper.",
        "Preheat a barbecue until the coals are white hot. (Alternatively, cook on a very hot griddle pan or under a high grill.)",
        "Remove the lamb chops from the marinade and drain off any excess oil. Season with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Place onto the barbecue with a sprig of rosemary over each chop and cook to your liking.",
        "Meanwhile, place the mushrooms onto the barbecue, buttered side up, and cook slowly.",
        "To serve, place the mushrooms and lamb chops onto a serving plate."
