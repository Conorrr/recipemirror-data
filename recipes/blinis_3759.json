        "Make a thin paste out of the yeast and 225g/8oz of the sifted flour diluted with the lukewarm milk.",
        "Leave this paste to ferment for two hours in a warm room atmosphere, and then add the rest of the flour (115g/4oz), the egg yolks, a pinch of salt, the tepid milk and mix together without letting it acquire any body. Finally add the whisked egg whites.",
        "Let the preparation ferment for half an hour, and when about to serve, cook the blinis quickly in the same way as pancakes, in special little omelette pans. Dish them up very hot on a napkin."
