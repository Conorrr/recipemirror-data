        "For the shortbread": [
            "225g/8oz plain flour",
            "100g/3\u00bdoz caster sugar",
            "225g/8oz butter, at room temperature",
            "100g/3\u00bdoz semolina",
            "25g/1oz demerara sugar"
        ],
        "For the filling": [
            "500g/1lb 1\u00bdoz strawberries, plus extra to garnish",
            "1\u00bd tbsp port",
            "2 tbsp caster sugar",
            "300ml/10\u00bdfl oz double cream, whipped to soft peaks",
            "300ml/10\u00bdfl oz thick, natural yoghurt",
            "2 egg whites, whipped to stiff peaks",
            "extra strawberries, to garnish"
        ]
    },
    "steps": [
        "Preheat the oven to 160C/320F/Gas 2. Put the flour, caster sugar, butter and semolina into a food processor and process until the mixture is thoroughly combined and comes together to form a dough. This can also be done by hand, rubbing the butter into the flour first, then adding the sugar and semolina and working the ingredients together to form a ball.",
        "Roll the dough out on a floured surface to 1-2cm/\u00bdin thick. Using a circular cookie cutter or the top of a drinking glass, cut the dough into circles. Place the circles into a lightly greased tin and sprinkle the top with the demerara sugar.",
        "Bake for 30-40 minutes, until the shortbread is pale golden and cooked through. Keep an eye on it in case it gets too brown. Allow the shortbread to cool for a few minutes then carefully lift each shortbread with a small palette knife and place on a wire rack to cool completely. (These can now be stored in an airtight container.)",
        "Meanwhile, make the filling. Place the strawberries, port and sugar into a pan and heat gently until the sugar dissolves, stirring and mashing the strawberries into a chunky salsa. Allow to cool.",
        "Fold together the whipped double cream, yoghurt and whipped egg white.",
        "Fold in the strawberry salsa, leaving swirls.",
        "Place one shortbread circle on a small plate and place on a large dollop of the strawberry cream.",
        "Place one whole strawberry on top of each dollop and serve."
