            "400g/14oz fresh broad beans, (about 300g/10\u00bdoz when podded)",
            "1 whole red chilli",
            "2 fat garlic cloves, finely chopped",
            "1 spring onion, thinly sliced",
            "1 lemon, zest and juice only",
            "1 tbsp dried oregano or 2 tbsp fresh chopped oregano",
            "\u00bd loaf sourdough bread, sliced",
            "4 tbsp olive oil",
            "200g/7oz soft goats\u2019 cheese"
        ]
    },
    "steps": [
        "Heat a large saucepan filled with boiling water. Blanch the beans very briefly (just to soften, not to cook them through). Drain and set aside to cool.",
        "Roast the chilli over a direct flame on the hob until blackened a little, but not completely charred. Alternatively, char them under a hot grill. Slice open and remove the seeds. Cut the flesh into thin ribbons.",
        "Mix the chilli, garlic, spring onion, lemon zest and juice together. Add the oregano and broad beans and lightly crush them as you mix. You don\u2019t want a smooth pur\u00e9e, but it needs to hold together.",
        "Heat a large griddle pan and drizzle the sliced sourdough with a little olive oil. Place on the griddle and cook on both sides for 1-2 minutes, or until the bar marks appear.",
        "Remove from the heat and spread with the goats\u2019 cheese. Top with the broad bean mixture and serve."
