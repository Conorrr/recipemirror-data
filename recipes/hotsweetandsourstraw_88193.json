        "For the hot, sweet and sour strawberries, heat the olive oil and sugar in a frying pan until caramelised. Add the split vanilla pod and red wine vinegar and simmer for two minutes. Add the strawberries and shake in the sauce for one minute. Remove the strawberries to a plate.",
        "Add the red wine to the pan and simmer for three minutes, or until the sauce has reduced slightly and turned syrupy.",
        "For the vanilla cream, whip the double cream, vanilla seeds and icing sugar together in a bowl until soft peaks form when the whisk is removed. Stir in the sugar-coated chocolate buttons.",
        "To serve, spoon the vanilla cream into the middle of a serving bowl. Pour the strawberries around the cream and then pour over the sauce from the frying pan."
