    "ingredients": {
        "default": [
            "250g/9oz strong bread flour, plus extra for dusting",
            "\u00bd tsp salt",
            "\u00bd tsp coriander seeds, toasted and ground",
            "\u00bd tsp smoked paprika",
            "4 tbsp olive oil",
            "100ml/3\u00bdfl oz warm water"
        ]
    },
    "steps": [
        "Mix the flour, salt, coriander seeds and paprika in a large bowl, make a well in the centre and add the olive oil and the warm water. Using a fork, start incorporating the flour with the water and olive oil, if necessary add more water. Once the dough starts to come together, use your hands to form a soft ball of dough.",
        "Dust your hands and a clean work surface with flour and knead the dough for five minutes, or until it is smooth and elastic. Put the dough back into the bowl, cover and set aside for 15 minutes. (This dough is much firmer to handle than bread dough and will feel heavier.)",
        "Divide the dough into five equal balls. Roll them out to the thickness of a \u00a32 coin. Heat a griddle pan and cook the flat breads for two minutes on each side.",
        "Serve immediately."
