        "Tip: You can make these skinny cupcakes with plain dark chocolate instead of blueberries if you like. Use 100g/3\u00bd oz roughly chopped dark chocolate or drops or buttons and you will add about 43 calories to each cupcake. You can also flavour the cakes with \u00bd tsp vanilla extract instead of lemon zest and use water instead of lemon juice to make the icing."
