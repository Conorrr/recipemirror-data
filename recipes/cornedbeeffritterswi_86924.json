        "Fold the egg white into the batter.",

        "For the onion marmalade, heat the olive oil in a pan over a medium heat.",
        "Add the onions, chillies, cloves and garlic and fry gently for 15-20 minutes, until the onions have softened and caramelised to a deep brown colour.",
        "Add the orange juice and zest, sherry vinegar and sugar and bring to the boil.",

        "To serve, divide the fritters evenly among four plates and top with a poached egg. Place a spoonful of marmalade alongside."
