        "default": [
            "500g/1lb 2oz strong white flour",
            "50g/1\u00beoz caster sugar",
            "10g/\u2153oz fast-acting yeast",
            "7g/\u00bcoz salt",
            "140ml/5fl oz full-fat milk",
            "6 free-range eggs, one egg beaten for egg wash",
            "250g/9oz unsalted butter, softened"
        ]
    },
    "steps": [
        "Put the flour, sugar, yeast, salt, milk and five eggs into a free-standing food mixer and mix, for about five minutes, to a smooth dough. If mixing by hand, this will take about eight minutes.",
        "Add the butter to the dough and mix for a further five minutes in the mixer, or 10 minutes by hand. Put the dough into a bowl, cover and leave in the fridge overnight.",
        "The dough should now be stiff and easily shaped. Cut the dough into 50g/1\u00beoz pieces and divide 45g/1\u00bdoz for the brioche bodies and 5g/\u00bcoz for the brioche heads.",
        "Using your hands, shape the dough pieces into balls. Put each large piece of dough into a brioche mould and push a smaller dough on top of each once. Leave the brioche in a warm place to rise for one hour.",
        "Preheat the oven to 200C/400F/Gas 6. Brush the brioche with the egg wash and bake for 20 minutes, or until golden-brown.",
        "Transfer to a wire rack to cool."
