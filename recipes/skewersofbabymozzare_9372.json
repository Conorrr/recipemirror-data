    "steps": [
        "To make the mozzarella skewers, heat the olive oil in a small pan and gently sweat the garlic, thyme and lemon zest for 2-3 minutes to soften and infuse. Remove from the heat and stir the lemon juice through. Allow to cool. Pour the mixture over the mozzarella balls in a bowl. Season and toss the cayenne and parsley through. Leave to marinade for as long as possible.",
        "Use a parisienne scoop to make about 20 balls from the melon flesh. (Reserve one melon half shell.) Wrap a piece of parma ham around each melon ball.",
        "Alternatively, arrange each of two mozzarella balls, melon balls and cherry tomatoes on each of 10 wooden skewers. Turn the reserved melon half shell, cut side down onto a plate or into a bowl and stick the prepared skewers in to display. Serve."
