            "250g/9oz beef mince",
            "25g/1oz butter",
            "200g/7oz white rice",
            "1 litre/1\u00be pint chicken or beef stock, made from a cube",

    "steps": [
        "Heat a large saucepan with a lid over a medium heat. Add the olive oil and, once hot, fry the onion with a pinch of salt for 5-6 minutes or until cooked through and lightly golden-brown. Add the garlic, cumin seeds and chilli and continue to cook for two minutes, or until aromatic.",
        "Add the beef mince to the pan and cook for 4-5 minutes, or until all the meat is brown rather than raw.",
        "Add the butter and, once melted, stir in the rice, mixing over the heat for two minutes so that the rice begins to absorb the melted butter and any juices in the pan. Pour in enough of the stock to cover the rice by 1cm/\u00bdin. Stir once, cover with a tight fitting lid, reduce the heat to medium-low and leave for five minutes.",
        "After five minutes remove the lid, add the peas and stir through. Poke some holes into the rice to allow any steam to escape and continue to cook with the lid off until all the liquid is absorbed and the rice is cooked through.",
        "Serve warm, dividing up the crisp rice at the bottom of the pan."
