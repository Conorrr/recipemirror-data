    "steps": [
        "Preheat the oven to 150C/300F/Gas 2.",
        "Place the flour, butter and sugar into a food processor and pulse until the mixture resembles breadcrumbs.",
        "Add the egg yolk and milk and pulse again until the mixture comes together into a ball. Leave to rest for five minutes.",
        "On a clean, floured work surface, roll the dough out to 0.5cm/\u00bdin thick with a rolling pin and cut into 3 x 6cm/2\u00bdin rounds. Place onto a baking sheet lined with silicon paper, sprinkle with a little more caster sugar and bake for 15 minutes, or until just turning golden on top. Place onto a wire rack and leave to cool.",
        "For the strawberries, place the strawberries, vanilla extract, wine, icing sugar and lemon juice into a small pan and cook over a gentle heat for five minutes, or until the strawberries are softened but still retain their shape.",
        "To serve, place one round of shortbread onto a serving plate and top with half of the strawberries and a spoonful of whipped cream. Top with another round of shortbread, the remaining strawberries and cream and finish with the last piece of shortbread."
