            "125g/4\u00bdoz salt cod, or other saltfish, soaked in water overnight (water changed several times)",

            "\u00bc red pepper, diced",
            "\u00bc green pepper, diced",
            "\u00bc onion, finely diced",
            "\u00bd Scotch bonnet chilli, seeded and finely chopped (use \u00bd green chilli for a milder version )",
            "freshly ground black pepper",
            "vegetable oil, for shallow frying"

    "steps": [
        "Drain the soaked salt cod and cook in boiling water for 20-25 minutes, or until the fish is flaky and tender. Drain the salt cod and flake the flesh, removing the skin and pin bones.",
        "Tip the flour into a bowl and stir in enough cold water to make a thick paste (about 250ml/9fl oz). Stir in the salt cod, red and green peppers, onions, scotch bonnet pepper and season with freshly ground black pepper.",
        "Heat 2.5cm/1in vegetable oil in a deep heavy-based frying pan until a breadcrumb sizzles and turns brown when dropped into it. (CAUTION: hot oil can be dangerous. Do not leave unattended.)",
        "Carefully place spoonfuls of the batter into the hot oil and fry for 2-3 minutes, or until the fritters are crisp and golden-brown (you may need to do this in batches). Remove from the pan with a slotted spoon and set aside to drain on kitchen paper to remove any excess oil."
