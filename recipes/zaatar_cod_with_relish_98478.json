    "steps": [
        "Mix the za\u2019atar with the olive oil in a small bowl to create a paste. Smear this paste over the cod pieces, ensuring they are well coated. Season each piece of fish with a pinch of salt. Place in a non-reactive container and leave to marinade in the fridge for 30 minutes.",
        "For the relish, place all the ingredients in a bowl and mix well. Do not season the mixture with salt as it will already have a salty taste.",
        "Heat a large frying pan over a medium heat, then drizzle in a generous amount of olive oil.",
        "Fry the cod for about 8 minutes on one side and 3-4 minutes on the other side. The cod should be golden-brown with a nice spice crusting.",
        "Serve the cod with a generous helping of the relish."
    ],
    "tips": [
        "To infuse the cod with more flavour you can allow it to marinade for longer than half an hour if you have time. You could marinade it overnight to make this a speedy supper for the following day."
