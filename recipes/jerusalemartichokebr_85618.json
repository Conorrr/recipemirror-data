        "Place the onion, artichokes and oil into a pan and add the thyme and bay leaf, tied together with string. Cover and sweat over a low heat for about 15 minutes, stirring occasionally.",

        "To serve, sprinkle with parsley. If using the bread and cheese, preheat the grill to medium. Toast the baguette lightly on both sides under the grill, then, just before serving, top with grated cheese and slide back under the grill to melt. Float a slice of cheese on toast in each bowl of soup as you serve."
