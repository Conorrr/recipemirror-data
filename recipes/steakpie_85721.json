    "steps": [
        "Dust the cubed steak with the seasoned flour",
        "Heat the oil in a large heavy-bottomed pan and fry the meat, stirring frequently, until browned on all sides.",
        "Add the sliced onions, herbs, salt and freshly ground black pepper and the stock and bring to the boil.",
        "Reduce the heat and simmer gently for an hour and a half.",
        "Preheat the oven to 190C/375F/Gas 5.",
        "Transfer the filling mixture to an ovenproof dish. Line the rim of the dish with a thin strip of pastry. Dampen the pastry rim by brushing with beaten egg. Cut a piece of pastry to fit across the top of the dish and place on top of the dish, pressing the edges together to seal. Decorate with pastry trimmings, make a steam hole in the centre of the pie by slashing with a sharp knife, then brush with more beaten egg.",
        "Transfer to the oven and cook for 1-1\u00bd hours. If the pastry gets too brown, cover it with foil. Serve hot."
