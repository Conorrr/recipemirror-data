            "85g/3oz self-raising flour",

    "steps": [
        "Preheat the oven to 220C/425F/Gas 7.",
        "In a bowl, mix together the flour and enough yoghurt to form a firm dough. Roll out on a flat surface to 2\u00bd/1in thickness and using a chefs' ring, cut into rounds.",
        "Heat a frying pan and add the dough rounds. Dry fry until the scones have puffed up and browned a little.",
        "For the plums, place the plums on a baking sheet. Place in the oven and bake for five minutes, until they have softened slightly.",
        "Meanwhile, place the blackcurrant conserve in a small saucepan with a splash of water and warm over a low heat.",
        "Remove the plums from the oven and cover with the warm blackcurrant conserve. Return to the oven for a further three minutes.",
        "To serve, place the scones onto a dish with the plum mixture poured over."
