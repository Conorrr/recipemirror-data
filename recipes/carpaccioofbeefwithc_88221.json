    "steps": [
        "For the carpaccio, begin by placing the steak between two sheets of silicone paper and flattening it out with a meat mallet or rolling pin. Place the beef onto a baking tray and place in the freezer to firm up but not freeze completely, about 20-30 minutes.",
        "In a bowl, whisk together the oil, vinegar and chilli flakes and season with salt and freshly ground black pepper.",
        "To serve, remove the steak from the freezer and slice thinly with a very sharp knife. Arrange the slices on a plate, drizzle over the chilli dressing and garnish with coriander, broad beans and a squeeze of lime juice."
