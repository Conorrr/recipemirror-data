        "Arrange the Swiss roll slices in the bottom of a large trifle dish. Generously soak the Swiss roll pieces with the sherry.",

        "Whisk the double cream until stiff peaks form when the whisk is removed, then slather it on top of the custard.",

        "Decorate the top of the trifle with the sliced glac\u00e9 cherries and candied angelica just before serving."
