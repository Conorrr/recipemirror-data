    "description": "Chicken shawarma is usually cooked on a spit, but this is roasted in the oven. Here, I\u2019ve served it modestly, on a pile of shredded iceberg, with some warmed pitta, lemon wedges and a tahini sauce. When I make this for groups of friends, or for a family lunch or supper, I slice up some fresh tomatoes sprinkled with mint, and cut some cucumbers into wedged slices, and macerate some red onions, cut into half-moons, with red wine vinegar or lime \u2013 in which case it will serve up to 10 people.",

    "tips": [
        "The chicken can be marinated 1 day ahead. Store in fridge until needed. The chicken can be frozen in its marinade \u2013 as long as the meat has not been previously frozen \u2013 for up to 3 months. Leftover chicken can also be frozen, in airtight containers or resealable bags, for up to 2 months. Defrost overnight in fridge before using."

        "default": [
            "12 skinless and boneless chicken thighs",
            "2 unwaxed lemons",
            "100ml/3\u00bdfl oz olive oil",
            "4 fat or 6 smaller garlic cloves, finely grated or minced",
            "2 dried or fresh bay leaves",
            "2 tsp paprika",
            "2 tsp ground cumin",
            "1 tsp ground coriander",
            "1 tsp dried chilli flakes",
            "\u00bc tsp ground cinnamon",
            "\u00bc tsp freshly grated nutmeg",
            "2 tsp sea salt flakes",
            "lettuce leaves, to serve"
        ],
        "For the shawarma sauce": [
            "250g/9oz plain yoghurt",
            "4 tbsp tahini",
            "1 fat or 2 smaller garlic cloves, finely grated or minced",
            "fat pinch salt, or to taste",
            "1 tbsp pomegranate seeds"
        ]
    },
    "steps": [
        "Take a large resealable freezer bag and put the chicken thighs in it. Using a fine grater, preferably a microplane, grate in the lemon zest. Squeeze the lemons and add the juice. Pour in the olive oil and add the garlic, then add all the remaining ingredients.",
        "Squish everything about together, then seal the bag, place it on a plate or in a dish, and refrigerate for at least 6 hours, or up to 1 day.",
        "When you\u2019re ready to cook, preheat the oven to 220C/200C Fan/Gas 7. Remove the chicken from the fridge and allow it to reach room temperature.",
        "Tip the contents of the freezer bag into a shallow roasting tin \u2013 mine measures 44x34x1.5cm/17x13x\u00bdin \u2013 and make sure all the chicken thighs are lying flat and not on top of one another (if possible) before roasting in the hot oven for 30 minutes, by which time they should be cooked through (though obviously you must check) and golden on top.",
        "When the chicken\u2019s more or less cooked, make the sauce simply by combining the yoghurt with the tahini and garlic, stir and salt to taste, and sprinkle with a few pomegranate seeds.",
        "Line a platter or a couple of plates with crisp lettuce, shredded or torn into pieces, and then top with the piping hot chicken, pouring the oily juices over them, unless you are, for some inexplicable reason, anti-oily-juices. If you wanted to make the chicken go further, you could cut the thighs into chunky slices rather than leaving them whole. And please do add any of the suggested accompaniments, itemized in my introduction."
