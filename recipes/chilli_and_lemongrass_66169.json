        "Once removed from the pan, brush the remaining glaze over the tuna. Allow to rest for a few minutes while you make the salad.",

        "To serve, cut the tuna into bite-size pieces and serve with the salad alongside. Garnish with baby coriander cress. Drizzle over any glaze that's left in the pan after cooking the tuna."
