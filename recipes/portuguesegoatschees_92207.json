        "Preheat the grill to its highest setting.",
        "Lay the slices of Parma ham onto a work surface and sprinkle over the herbs. Season, to taste, with freshly ground black pepper.",
        "Place pieces of the cheese into the centre of each slice of Parma ham, then wrap the ham around the cheese to form 12 parcels. Secure with cocktail sticks.",
        "Place the ham and cheese parcels onto a baking tray and drizzle over the olive oil. Grill for 3-4 minutes, or until the ham is crisp and golden-brown and the cheese has melted.",
        "Meanwhile, for the salad, whisk together the olive oil and lemon juice in the bottom of a large serving bowl until well combined. Add the remaining salad ingredients and mix well to coat the salad in the dressing. Season, to taste, with salt and freshly ground black pepper.",
        "To serve, slice the goats' cheese parcels and divide them equally among four serving plates. Pile the salad alongside."
