        "For the filling": [
            "300g/10\u00bdoz pumpkin, peeled and cut into bite-sized pieces",
            "25g/1oz butter, cubed",
            "2 tbsp caster sugar",
            "3 tbsp ginger syrup (from a jar of stem ginger)",
            "200ml/7fl oz double cream, whipped",
            "200g/7oz cream cheese",
            "100g/3\u00bdoz thick Greek yoghurt",
            "3 pieces stem ginger, finely chopped, plus extra for garnish"
        ],
        "For the base": [
            "10 gingernut biscuits",
            "50g/1\u00beoz melted butter"
        ]
    },
    "steps": [
        "Preheat the oven 200C/400F/Gas 6.",
        "For the filling, place the chopped pumpkin on a baking tray. Dot with butter, sprinkle over the caster sugar and drizzle with the ginger syrup. Bake in the oven for 30\u201335 minutes, or until the pumpkin is soft.",
        "For the base, crush the gingernuts until they resemble breadcrumbs; you can do this in a food processor or by placing the biscuits in a food bag and bashing them with a rolling pin. Place the crushed biscuits in a bowl and stir in the melted butter until well combined.",
        "Line a baking tray with baking parchment. Place four metal chefs\u2019 rings on the tray. Divide the gingernut mixture between the bases and, using the back of a spoon, press the mixture down to form a smooth base.",
        "For the filling, put the roasted pumpkin and any cooking juices in a food processor. Pulse until you have a smooth pur\u00e9e. Taste and add more sugar if required.",
        "Mix the whipped cream, cream cheese and yoghurt together in a bowl. Add the stem ginger and mix well. Swirl the pumpkin pur\u00e9e through the cream mixture, then spoon it on the biscuit bases. Smooth over the tops and place in the fridge for 1-2 hours, or until set.",
        "When ready to serve, remove the chefs\u2019 rings (you may need to run a hot cloth or blowtorch round the outside of the tins to help ease out the cheesecakes) and decorate the top of the cheesecakes with extra stem ginger."
