        "default": [
            "1 x 450g/1lb sea bream, scaled and gutted (or 2 x 160g/5\u00bdoz sea bream fillets)",
            "6 cloves of roasted garlic, skin left on (simply roast garlic cloves, wrapped in foil, in a hot oven with a drizzle of olive oil and sea salt for about ten minutes)",
            "1 small dried chilli (or to taste)",
            "a few sprigs fresh rosemary",
            "pinch of sea salt",
            "2 tbsp dry white wine",
            "50ml/2fl oz good-quality, fruity, extra virgin olive oil"
        ],
        "To serve": [
            "chopped parsley",
            "1 lemon, quartered"
        ]
    },
    "steps": [
        "Preheat the oven to 220C/430F/Gas 7. Using a sharp, flexible knife, remove the fillets from the sea bream (or ask your fishmonger to do this for you).",
        "Place a large piece of aluminium foil, about 60cm/24in long, onto a work surface and cover with a layer of parchment paper almost the same size. Fold over the edges so that the foil and parchment are secured together at the edges.",
        "Place the fillets onto the parchment paper and scatter over the roasted garlic cloves (squeeze them gently to release the soft insides as you do so).",
        "Crumble over the dried chilli and scatter over some rosemary leaves. Season with sea salt and pour over the wine. Drizzle over the olive oil.",
        "Seal the parchment paper and foil around the fish. Start at the ends, rolling them inwards to ensure the ends are properly sealed, then crimp the sides to create a pasty-shaped parcel. The parcel should be tightly sealed so that the fish steams as it cooks without any steam escaping.",
        "Place the fish in a roasting tray. Place in the preheated oven and roast for 8-10 minutes.",
        "When cooked, remove from the oven and place onto a large serving plate. Carefully undo the foil and parchment, folding back the sides.",
        "To serve, sprinkle over some chopped fresh parsley and squeeze over fresh lemon juice to taste."
