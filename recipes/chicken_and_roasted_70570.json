        "For the pesto, place all the ingredients except the oil in a food processor and blend. Gradually add the oil until you have a thick paste, and set aside.",
        "For the chicken and roasted vegetable layered loaf, place the red and yellow peppers directly on a gas flame and keep turning until black all over. Remove from the hob and place in a glass bowl with cling film over, and set aside. Once cool enough to handle, peel the black skin off and cut the flesh into quarters, removing the seeds.",
        "Heat a large griddle pan and place the chicken strips in a bowl. Add the oil and season with salt and pepper, then toss to coat.",
        "Place the chicken on the hot griddle along with the red onion and courgettes and cook for 2-3 minutes.",
        "Slice off the top of the loaf of bread. Hollow out the loaf by scooping out the soft bread, leaving 3cm/1\u00bcin of bread around the edge.",
        "Fill the hollow loaf with layers of the peppers, chicken, red onion, courgettes, mozzarella, tomatoes and pesto, seasoning between each layer.",
        "Place the lid of the loaf back on and push down, you can wrap it in cling film and leave overnight or slice straight away.",
        "For the seasonal salad, whisk together the oil, vinegar and mustard in a small bowl. Place the salad leaves in a large bowl, pour over the dressing and mix.",
        "To serve, slice the loaf and place on serving plates with the dressed salad."
