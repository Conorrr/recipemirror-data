            "1kg/2lb 3oz mussels",
            "drizzle olive oil",
            "1 shallot, finely chopped",
            "2 garlic cloves, finely chopped",

    "steps": [
        "Clean and debeard the mussels. If any mussels are opened, tap them lightly on a hard surface. If they don't close, discard them.",
        "Heat the olive oil in a wide, heavy-based pan. Add the shallots and garlic and cook until softened, but not browned.",
        "Add the wine to the pan and boil for a minute to burn off the alcohol.",
        "Add the mussels to the pan. Add most of the chopped parsley, cover the pan with a lid and cook the mussels for about 3-4 minutes, giving the pan a shake from time to time. The mussels are cooked when they've opened up. Be sure to discard any that don't open.",
        "Sprinkle in the remaining parsley, then spoon the mussels into a serving bowl. Pour over the cooking liquid and serve with some crusty bread."
