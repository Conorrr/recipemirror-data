        "In a large bowl whisk the egg whites until they form stiff peaks.",
        "Gradually add the sugar and continue whisking until the mixture is thick enough to leave a ribbon trail when the whisk is lifted.",
        "Carefully add the mashed banana and fold in gently, making sure to maintain volume in the egg whites.",
        "Fill the two ramekins with the mixture. Run a thumb nail or tea spoon handle round the edge to 1cm/\u00bdin depth. Place the souffl\u00e9s onto the hot baking sheet and place in the oven.",
        "Cook for ten minutes, until the souffl\u00e9 has risen by about an inch.",
        "To serve, place the souffl\u00e9 on the centre of a plate and dust with icing sugar."
