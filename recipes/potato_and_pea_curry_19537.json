    "description": "Aloo dum is possibly the most common vegetable curry in India. It\u2019s almost like chips with everything here, aloo dum with everything there. It\u2019s either easy to make or hard, depending on what you want to do with it. If I was describing it to somebody I\u2019d just say boil potatoes, fry them with garam masala, add some tomato, chilli, turmeric and salt and it\u2019s done; then, if you like, throw in frozen peas just before the end. This meal, if served as 8 portions, provides 223kcal, 4g protein, 28g carbohydrate (of which 4g sugars), 10g fat (of which 1.5g saturates), 4g fibre and 0.4g salt per portion.",
