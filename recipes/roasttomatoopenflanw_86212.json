        "Preheat the oven to 200C/400F/Gas 6.",
        "Place the puff pastry onto a baking sheet and, with a sharp knife, score a 1cm/\u00bdin border around the edge of the pastry. Prick with a fork inside the border. Mix the egg and the cream together and then brush the edges of the pastry with the mixture.",
        "Place the cherry tomatoes into a bowl and drizzle over half of the honey, the vinegar, oil and spring onion. Season, to taste, with salt and freshly ground black pepper and mix well. Fill inside the border of the pastry with the cherry tomato mixture.",
        "Bake in the oven for ten minutes, or until the pastry has puffed up and turned golden brown.",
        "To serve, drizzle with the rest of the honey and slide onto a serving plate."
