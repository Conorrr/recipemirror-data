        "default": [
            "750g/1lb10oz bintje potatoes, you can also use Yukon Gold or Yellow Finn potatoes",
            "2 egg yolks",
            "\u00bd cup plain flour (plus extra if needed)",
            "sea salt, to season",
            "freshly grated parmesan cheese"
        ],
        "For the tomato sauce": [
            "1/3 cup extra virgin olive oil",
            "2 cloves of garlic, sliced thinly",
            "4 ripe tomatoes, chopped",
            "2 tbsp basil, sliced thinly"
        ]
    },
    "steps": [
        "Cook the whole, unpeeled potatoes in boiling salted water for about 25 minutes or until tender. Drain.",
        "When cool enough to handle but still warm, peel the potatoes and pass them through a mouli or ricer. It is important the potatoes are still warm at this stage.",
        "Place the potato on a clean work surface, add the egg yolks and about \u00bd cup of plain flour. Fold the mixture together working towards the centre, gradually adding more flour if the mixture is too wet. Be careful not to add too much flour as the more flour added the firmer the gnocchi will be. Once the gnocchi mixture has come together rest for 5 minutes.",
        "Cut the gnocchi mixture in quarters and on a lightly floured surface roll each piece into a sausage shape about 2cm/\u00bein in diameter, then cut into 3cm/1\u00bcin pieces.",
        "Place the gnocchi on a wooden board or floured tray. At this stage the gnocchi can be covered with a damp tea towel and left for 1-2 hours.",
        "For the tomato sauce, heat the extra virgin olive oil in a frying pan, add the garlic and sea salt to taste and cook over a low heat for 2-3 minutes until pale golden.",
        "Add the tomatoes and cook gently for 4-5 minutes. Add the basil and stir well.",
        "Meanwhile, cook the gnocchi in gently boiling salted water for 2-3 minutes or until they float.",
        "Drain the gnocchi and place in pasta bowls, spoon the sauce over and scatter with freshly grated parmesan."
