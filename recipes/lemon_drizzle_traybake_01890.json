    "description": "I have been making lemon drizzle cake for as long as I can remember \u2013 since the 1960s at least! This is the recipe I am most asked for when stopped in the street, so here it is! Equipment and preparation: for this recipe you will need a 30x23cm/12x9in tray bake or roasting tin.",

    "tips": [
        "Tip 1: It is important to spoon the glaze on to the cake while it\u2019s still warm so the lemon juice soaks in properly. Tip 2: Lemon balm works well as an alternative for lemon verbena if you can\u2019t get hold of any, or you could use finely chopped lemon thyme leaves. Tip 3: This traybake can be stored in an airtight container for 3\u20134 days and frozen for up to a month."

        "default": [
            "225g/8oz baking spread, straight from the fridge, or butter at room temperature, plus extra for greasing",
            "225g/8oz caster sugar",
            "275g/10oz self-raising flour",
            "2 level tsp baking powder",
            "4 free-range eggs",
            "4 tbsp milk",
            "2 lemons, zest only",
            "1 heaped tbsp very finely chopped lemon verbena (optional)"
        ],
        "For the glaze": [
            "175g/6oz granulated sugar",
            "2 lemons, juice only"

    "steps": [
        "Preheat the oven to 180C/160C Fan/Gas 4. Grease the tin with baking spread and line the base with baking paper.",
        "Measure all the ingredients into a large bowl and beat for 2 minutes, or until well blended. Turn the mixture into the prepared tin and level the top.",
        "Bake for 35\u201340 minutes until the cake has shrunk a little from the sides of the tin and springs back when lightly touched with a fingertip in the centre of the cake.",
        "Meanwhile, make the glaze. Mix the granulated sugar with the lemon juice and stir to a runny consistency.",
        "Leave the cake to cool for 5 minutes in the tin, then lift out, with the lining paper still attached, and place on wire rack set over a tray.",
        "Brush the glaze all over the surface of the warm cake and leave to set. Remove the lining paper and cut into slices to serve."
