        "Place the melted butter and ginger biscuit crumbs into a bowl and mix well.",
        "Place a 7cm/3in chefs' ring onto a plate and add the biscuit mixture, pressing down well to form a compact base.",
        "Place the mascarpone, cream, ginger and honey in a clean bowl and mix well. Spoon the mascarpone cream mixture into the ring mould onto the biscuit base and smooth over the top.",
        "For the sauce, place all of the sauce ingredients into a saucepan over a medium heat and stir until thick glossy sauce is formed.",
        "For the praline, add the sugar and nuts to a separate saucepan over a medium heat and caramelise gently.",
        "Pour the caramelised nuts out onto a non-stick baking sheet, spread out and leave to cool. Once cooled and set, smash the praline into pieces with a toffee hammer or a rolling pin.",
        "To serve, carefully remove the chefs' ring from the cheesecake, drizzle over the chocolate sauce and sprinkle with praline pieces."
