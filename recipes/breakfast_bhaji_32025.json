        "Cook the potatoes in boiling salted water for about 10 minutes, or until tender. Remove with a slotted spoon, set aside, then cook the carrots in the same water for about three minutes, or until just tender but still with a bit of crunch.",
        "Heat the oil in a heavy-based saucepan or karahi and fry the mustard seeds until they start to pop. Add the onion and fry over a moderate heat for five minutes, or until softened. Add the chilli powder and turmeric and fry for 30 seconds, then add the potatoes, carrots, tomatoes, salt, garam masala and 50ml/2fl oz water. Cook for 3-5 minutes, stirring to break up the potatoes a bit, until the tomatoes are reduced and jammy.",
        "To serve, brush the Indian bread with a little melted ghee, butter or vegetable oil if you like, or leave plain. Serve the bhaji with naan breads and a fried egg."

    "tips": [
        "You can easily buy garam masala instead of making your own \u2013 just ensure it\u2019s fresh for the best flavour. The recipe makes more than you will need but any excess can be stored in a sealed container out of sunlight; it will keep its most aromatic condition for a month."
