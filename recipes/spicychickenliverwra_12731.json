        "Cook for 4-5 minutes, until browned on the outside but still pink on the inside, or longer if you prefer them well done. Toss in the coriander and mint and check the seasoning, adding a squeeze of lemon juice if you like and serve immediately.",
        "Sprinkle sliced onion tossed with some chopped coriander, mint and lime juice, on the bottom of the tortilla then place the liver about and roll. Serve."
