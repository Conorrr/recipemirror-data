    "steps": [
        "Kid\u2019s job: For the beany dip, place the chickpeas or beans into a bowl or a food processor. Blend or mash with a fork or masher (or the end of a rolling pin!) until the beans are a rough paste. Some beans will mash more easily than others. You can leave them chunky or keep going until they are smooth. Add the crushed garlic and tahini (if using) and mix well. To get the right \u201cdippable\u201d consistency add a teaspoon each of water, olive oil and lemon juice and mix well. Keep adding water, oil and lemon until the dip is the texture and taste you want. Add a little salt and pepper, to taste.",
        "Kid\u2019s job: For the cucumber yoghurt dip, grate the cucumber with a rotary grater or box grater (a grown up should supervise this). Add to a bowl with the yoghurt, lemon juice, olive oil. Add any herbs if you like, chopped with scissors. Stir well and then taste- add more lemon or seasoning as needed.",
        "Kid\u2019s job: For the fruity salsa, carefully chop the cherry tomatoes or big tomatoes into small pieces using a salad knife (a grown up should supervise this) stir the chopped tomatoes together with the chopped spring onions, cucumber, mango and sweetcorn. Mix in any chopped herbs you want to add, with a teaspoon of olive oil and have a taste. You may want to add a squeeze of lemon or a pinch of sugar.",
        "Serve the dips with crusty bread, strips of pitta bread for dipping or use as a topping for wraps and sandwiches."

    "tips": [
        "Safety first! Graters can be really sharp and can cut small knuckles so make sure you only use larger pieces of vegetable which keep fingers away from the metal blade. Always use graters resting on a chopping board, not held over bowls. You can help by gently holding the vegetable and the child\u2019s hand for the first few grates so they can feel what to do. Use a knife which doesn\u2019t have a pointy end- you can buy plastic \u201csalad knives\u201d for very little money which are ideal for kids to use, they can also use scallop-edged \"sandwich knife\" (not a serrated one which cuts fingers easily). Kids may need help chopping hard vegetables. There are lots of things that can be ripped by hand or chopped with (clean, child-friendly) scissors - herbs, greens, spring onions and salad don\u2019t really need to be chopped with a knife."
