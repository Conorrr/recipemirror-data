        "For the wedges, wash the potatoes in their skins and then boil in salted water until only just cooked. Drain and allow to cool.",
        "Meanwhile, melt the duck fat in a saucepan over a low heat. Cut the potatoes into wedges, then dip in the duck fat.",
        "Grill the potatoes on the barbeque or griddle pan, brushing with duck fat as needed.",
        "To serve, slice the meat, re-heating if necessary. Melt the butter and pour over the steak. Serve with the potatoes and a green salad."
