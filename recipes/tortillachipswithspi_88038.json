        "For the tortilla chips, place the vegetable oil into a deep, heavy-based saucepan and heat until a small cube of bread sizzles and turns golden-brown when dropped into it. (CAUTION: hot oil can be dangerous. Do not leave unattended.)",
        "Carefully place the tortilla triangles into the hot oil and deep fry for 3-4 minutes, or until turning golden-brown and crisp. Remove with a slotted spoon and drain on kitchen paper. Scatter with sea salt.",
        "For the spicy yoghurt dip, place all the dip ingredients into a mini blender and blend to a coarse pur\u00e9e. Spoon into a small serving bowl.",
        "For the corn salsa, heat the olive oil in a medium frying pan, add the corn kernels and fry for 2-3 minutes. Add the chopped onion and fry for two minutes. Add the garlic and fry for one minute.",
        "Add the finely chopped peppers and fry for two minutes. Add the chipotle chillies, Cajun spice, salt and freshly ground black pepper and stir well over a gentle heat for one minute. Stir in the chopped coriander.",
        "To serve, spoon the salsa onto a serving plate. Place the small bowl of yoghurt dip in the middle of the serving plate and then place the crisp tortillas around the edge. Serve while the tortillas are still warm."
