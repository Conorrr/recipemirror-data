        "Spoon one-quarter of the filling onto the corner nearest you. Fold this corner towards the centre and tuck it under the filling. Fold the two outside corners in towards the middle so it looks like an envelope. Brush with oil, then roll up the pastry to look like a sausage. Repeat with the remaining mixture and pastry.",
