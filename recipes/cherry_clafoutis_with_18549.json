        "For the clafoutis, preheat the oven to 180C/350F/Gas 4. Place the eggs and sugar in a large bowl and whisk together. Sift over the flour and whisk well then stir in cream or cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche and milk. Leave to rest for 10 minutes.",
        "Lightly butter a large baking dish and sprinkle with sugar to coat. Scatter the cherries in the dish and gently pour over the clafoutis batter. Bake for 20-25 minutes or until the batter is just firm to the touch. If it is too soft in the centre, bake for a further five minutes. Remove from the oven and allow to cool a little before serving.",
        "Whip together the cream, sugar and vanilla seeds to soft peaks and spoon over the clafoutis."
