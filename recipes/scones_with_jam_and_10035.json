        "Tip the mixture out onto a lightly floured work surface. Using the palm of your hand, flatten out the dough out until it is about 2cm/1in thick. Cut out 8-12 scones using a 5cm/2in fluted cutter.",
        "Place the scones on to the lined baking tray and bake for 12-15 minutes, or until the scones are golden-brown and well-risen. Remove from the oven and place onto a wire rack until cool enough to handle.",
