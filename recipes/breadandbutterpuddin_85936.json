        "Grease a 1 litre/2 pint pie dish with butter.",
        "Cut the crusts off the bread. Spread each slice with on one side with butter, then cut into triangles.",

Sprinkle with a little cinnamon, then repeat the layers of bread and sultanas, sprinkling with cinnamon, until you have used up all of the bread. Finish with a layer of bread, then set aside.",
        "Gently warm the milk and cream in a pan over a low heat to scalding point. Don't let it boil.",

        "Preheat the oven to 180C/355F/Gas 4.",
