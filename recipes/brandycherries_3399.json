        "Have ready some wide-mouthed glass bottles, perfectly clean and dry.",
        "Remove half the stalks from the cherries.",
        "Put them in the bottles, strewing the sugar between each layer; and when the bottles are nearly full, pour in enough brandy to cover them.",
        "A few blanched bitter almonds or peach kernals is thought to be an improvement.",
        "Put corks or bungs in the bottles, tie them over with bladder, and store in a dry place. The cherries will be fit to eat in 2 or 3 months, and will keep well for years."
