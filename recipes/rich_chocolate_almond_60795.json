        "To make the chocolate glaze, in a bowl sitting over a saucepan of simmering water, making sure the bowl does not touch the water. Melt the chocolate, milk and butter together and stir until smooth. Stir in whisky, to taste. Allow to cool a little until it has thickened slightly (about 10 minutes) but do not place in the fridge as it will lose its glossy sheen.",
        "Take the cooled cake out of the tin and place on a plate or cake stand, and pour the glaze over the top, letting it drizzle down the sides."
