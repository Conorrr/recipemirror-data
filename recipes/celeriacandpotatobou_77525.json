        "Preheat the oven to 200C/450F/Gas 6.",
        "Heat a frying pan until hot then add half the butter and all the onions.",
        "Sweat for 3-4 minutes until just softened.",
        "Place a layer of celeriac slices into the bottom of a buttered ovenproof dish.",
        "Top with a layer of onions, then potatoes, then onions again, seasoning with salt and freshly ground black pepper as you go.",
        "Repeat with the remaining celeriac, onions and potatoes, finishing with a layer of potatoes.",
        "Dot with the remaining butter.",
        "Pour over the hot stock so all the layers are covered.",
        "Transfer to the oven and cook for 45-60 minutes, checking occasionally to make sure the stock hasn't completely evaporated, and pressing the layers down with the back of a spoon.",
        "Bake until nearly all the stock is absorbed and the top layer is golden brown.",
        "Serve."
