        "For the apples, preheat the oven to 150C/300F/Gas 2. Slice the eating apples very finely on a mandolin then lay onto a silicone or parchment lined tray and place in the oven for one hour until dried and slighty crisp. Remove from the oven and allow to cool.",
        "Place the cooking apples, butter and 2-3 tbsp water into a saucepan, cover and cook for 4-5 minutes or until the apples have broken down. Stir and season with the sugar and a little salt. Set aside and keep warm.",
        "Meanwhile, make the soup. Heat a deep saut\u00e9 pan until hot, add the olive oil, onion and garlic and cook gently for two minutes until just softened. Add the cauliflower and chicken stock and bring to the boil.",
        "Reduce the heat and simmer for 8-12 minutes or until the cauliflower is tender.",
        "Blend the soup to a pur\u00e9e in a food processor, then return to the saucepan and add the cream. Season with salt and freshly ground black pepper, return to the boil and simmer for one minute.",
        "For the gnocchi, mix the potato, egg yolks, flour, salt, apple and parsley together in a bowl until it just forms a soft dough. Season with salt and freshly ground black pepper.",
        "Divide the mixture in half and roll each piece on a lightly floured surface into a long sausage shape, about 1cm/1/2in diameter. Using a sharp knife, cut each sausage into 2.5cm/1in pieces of gnocchi.",
        "Bring a large saucepan of salted water to the boil. Drop the gnocchi into the water and cook for 1-2 minutes, or until they float to the surface.",
        "Remove the gnocchi from the water with a slotted spoon and place onto a plate lined with kitchen paper.",
        "Heat a frying pan until hot, add the oil and the gnocchi and fry for 1-2 minutes until golden-brown and just crisp. Drain onto kitchen paper.",
        "To serve, place a pile of apple pur\u00e9e into the centre of the soup bowl and top with a few gnocchi. Spoon the soup around the pur\u00e9e and finish with an apple crisp."
