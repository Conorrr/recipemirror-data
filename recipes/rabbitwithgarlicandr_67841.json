        "Season the rabbit with salt and freshly ground black pepper and dust with the flour",
        "Heat the extra virgin olive oil in a large, heavy-based frying pan. When hot add the floured rabbit chunks and seal well on all sides, until golden brown and quite crisp. Reduce the heat, add the garlic and rosemary and cover with a lid. Cook gently for 30 minutes, turning the pieces of rabbit from time to time. Raise the heat to high, remove the lid, add the wine and simmer until it has evaporated.",
        "When the rabbit is ready, make the bruschetta. Toast some slices of bread, immediately rub them with the garlic and then drizzle with some of the olive oil that will have risen to the top of the rabbit sauce. Serve the rabbit accompanied by the bruschetta."
