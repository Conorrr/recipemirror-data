        "Preheat the oven to 180C/350F/Gas 4. Lightly butter the insides of two ramekins.",
        "For the souffl\u00e9, place the pomegranate seeds into a pan along with the red wine and heat for 4-5 minutes. Remove from the heat and stir in the cornflour to thicken.",
        "In a mixing bowl, whisk together the egg whites and caster sugar until stiff peaks form when the whisk is removed, then fold in the pomegranate mixture.",
        "Spoon the mixture into the buttered ramekin dishes and tap the bases against a hard work surface to release any trapped air. Place the ramekins onto a baking tray and bake in the oven for 5-7 minutes, or until risen and golden-brown.",
        "For the orange yoghurt, combine all of the yoghurt ingredients in a bowl and mix well.",
        "Serve the souffl\u00e9s immediately alongside a small bowl of the orange yoghurt, garnished with fresh mint."
