        "Mix together the beaten eggs, cornflour, chilli flakes and Sichuan peppercorns in a large bowl, then gradually whisk in cold sparkling water until the batter reaches the consistency of double cream.",
        "Pour the vegetable oil into a large saucepan or deep-fat fryer and heat until a small cube of bread dropped in sizzles and turns golden in 30 seconds. (CAUTION: hot oil can be dangerous. Do not leave unattended.)",
        "Dip the corn chunks and turkey slices into the batter and then gently drop each into the hot oil in small batches. Deep-fry for 3-4 minutes, or until crisp and golden-brown, and the turkey is cooked through. Remove with a slotted spoon and drain on kitchen paper.",
        "Pile the sweetcorn and turkey fritters onto a serving plate and sprinkle over the chopped fresh chives and coriander leaves, season with salt and freshly ground black pepper and garnish with the lime wedges."
