    "steps": [
        "To make the salsa, put the kale, onion, peppers, chilli, courgette, garlic and passata into a bowl. Season with salt and pepper and mix well.",
        "Heat the oil in a medium lidded frying pan over a medium heat and add a quarter of the salsa. Stir to warm through, then make a hole in the middle of the salsa. Place the butter in the clear area in the middle of the pan, then break 2 eggs into this space.",
        "Put the lid on the pan and cook for 3-4 minutes. The dish is ready when the eggs are cooked into the salsa and the whites are firm. Slide the eggs and salsa onto a large plate and keep warm as you repeat this process three more times.",
        "To serve, sprinkle each dish with coriander leaves and serve the warm tortillas and chilli sauce alongside."
