        "Place the egg whites into a bowl and whisk until stiff peaks form when the whisk is removed from the bowl.",
        "Whisk in the sugar, one spoonful at a time, only adding more when the previous spoon has fully combined, until all the sugar is used.",
        "Spoon the mixture onto the Swiss roll tin and bake in the oven for 15 minutes.",
        "Dust a piece of greaseproof paper with icing sugar. Turn the meringue out of the tin and set aside to cool.",

        "Spread the filling over the meringue. Add the whipped cream and cover with the raspberries.",
        "Whilst holding the greaseproof paper, carefully roll up the meringue lengthways into a roulade shape. Dust with more icing sugar and slice into portions to serve."
