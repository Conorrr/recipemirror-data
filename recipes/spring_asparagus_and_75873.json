    "steps": [
        "Place the asparagus in a large bowl of iced water to freshen and bring out the colour.",
        "Bring a large pan of water to the boil and add the white wine vinegar.",
        "To poach the eggs, stir the boiling water to form a whirlpool and crack the eggs into the water, one or two at a time. Poach for three minutes, or until the white is cooked and the yolk is runny. Remove with a slotted spoon and set aside.",
        "Meanwhile, heat a little olive oil in a non-stick frying pan with a lid. Take 10 of the asparagus spears and roll them in the hot oil. Add a little chicken stock and a knob of butter and season with salt and pepper before covering with a lid.",
        "Cook gently for 3-4 minutes, adding a little of the remaining chicken stock if needed.",
        "Once the asparagus is cooked, remove from the pan and set aside. Simmer the cooking liquid until the volume of the liquid has halved, adding a little butter to thicken and a dash of sherry vinegar or balsamic vinegar, to taste.",
        "Finely slice the reserved raw asparagus spears lengthways.",
        "Serve the cooked asparagus and poached eggs in shallow bowls with a little of the sauce, and garnish with the slices of raw asparagus."
