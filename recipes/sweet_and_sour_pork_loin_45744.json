        "For the ribs": [
            "2 tsp sunflower oil",
            "600g/1lb 5oz rack pork loin ribs, cut into four portions",
            "1 tbsp Chinese five-spice powder"
        ],
        "For the garnish": [
            "1 spring onion"
        ],
        "For the glaze": [
            "3 tbsp tomato ketchup",
            "3 tbsp balsamic vinegar or rice vinegar",
            "2 tbsp dark soy sauce",
            "2 squidges honey",
            "2cm/\u00bein piece fresh root ginger, very finely chopped",
            "1 red chilli, seeds removed (if you prefer it a little less hot), very finely chopped",

    "steps": [
        "Preheat the oven to 200C/400F/Gas 6 (fan 180C). Line a large roasting tray with foil and grease with the oil. Place the pork ribs in the roasting tin and rub the Chinese five-spice powder all over each side of them. Roast in the oven for 30 minutes.",
        "Meanwhile, prepare the garnish. Cut the spring onion in half across and then cut each piece into really thin lengthwise strips. Put them into a small bowl of iced water, cover and sit in the freezer until ready to serve.",
        "For the glaze, put all the glaze ingredients together in a small pan. Bring to the boil and then turn off the heat.",
        "Once the ribs have been cooking for 30 minutes, remove from the oven. Brush half of the glaze over each side of the ribs. Cover with foil and return to the oven for another 1 hour 30 minutes. Reserve the remaining glaze in the pan for later.",
        "A few minutes before the ribs are ready, reheat the remaining glaze. Arrange the cooked ribs on a large serving platter and pour the warm glaze evenly over. Drain the spring onion garnish from the iced water. The onions should now have curled nicely. Scatter them over the ribs to garnish and serve at once."
