        "Heat the oil in a 20-25cm/8-10in non-stick frying pan over a medium heat. Add the onions and cook over a low heat for 4-5 minutes, or until soft. Add the sundried tomatoes and fry for 2 minutes.",
        "Turn the heat up a little and use a ladle to pour the socca batter into the pan. Cook for 6 minutes on each side, or until golden and slightly crisp. You should be able to lift the edges of the pancake away from the pan and easily lift and flip the pancake without it breaking.",
        "Transfer the pancake to a plate and scatter with the avocado, roasted peppers and coriander. Season with pepper and serve immediately."

    "tips": [
        "You can either make one large pancake or divide the mixture into two (including the diced onion and sundried tomatoes) and cook two slightly smaller and thinner pancakes."
