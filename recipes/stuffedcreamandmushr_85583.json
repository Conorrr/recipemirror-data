        "For the pancakes, place the beaten eggs and the flour into a large bowl and mix well. Gradually whisk in the milk to make a batter the consistency of double cream (you may not need it all).",
        "Heat a little of the oil in a frying pan over a medium-high heat and wipe out the excess with kitchen paper. Add a ladleful of the batter to the pan and fry until golden-brown on both sides, turning with a fish slice. Remove the pancake from the pan and repeat the process with the remaining batter to make three pancakes.",
        "For the filling, heat the oil in a frying pan, add the mushrooms and gently fry for 3-4 minutes. Add the garlic and chilli flakes and cook for 1-2 minutes. Season well with salt and freshly ground black pepper, add the cream and simmer for 1-2 minutes. Remove from the heat and stir in the herbs.",
        "To serve, place the pancakes onto plates and place equal amounts of the filling mixture onto each pancake. Roll the pancakes up and cut each one in half."
