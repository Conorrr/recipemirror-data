        "Preheat the oven to 200C/400F/Gas 6.",
        "For the stuffed pears, place the pear halves cut-side up onto a non-stick baking sheet.",
        "Place the crushed amaretti biscuits, rum and egg yolk into a small bowl and mix well. Use this mixture to fill the cavities of the pear halves, then drizzle over the red wine.",
        "Transfer to the oven and bake for 8-10 minutes, or until the pears are softened.",
        "For the red wine sauce, place the red wine into a small saucepan and bring to the boil. Reduce the heat, add the vanilla pod and seeds and simmer for 10-12 minutes, or until the wine has reduced by half. Remove the vanilla pod.",
        "To serve, place the pears onto plates and pour over the red wine sauce. Dust with icing sugar and serve with a dollop of Greek-style yoghurt."
