    "tips": [
        "The cabbage should be cooked for 15-20 minutes more if it isn\u2019t finely shredded. This dish freezes well. Let the cooked cabbage cool completely, then transfer to a freezer-safe container (it will keep in the freezer for 3 months). Defrost in the microwave or overnight in the fridge. Reheat in a microwave or in a saucepan on the hob."
