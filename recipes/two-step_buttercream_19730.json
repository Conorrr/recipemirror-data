        "In a jug, stir the icing sugar into the cream until dissolved, then add any colouring or flavouring you want, or just leave it plain. Beat this gradually into the butter mixture until light and fluffy.",
        "This buttercream keeps very well covered at room temperature for 2-3 days and can be warmed slightly and re-beaten if the texture is too firm."
