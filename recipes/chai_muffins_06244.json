    "description": "Taking tea in muffin form seems ideal for breakfast, and the warm spices of chai bring scented richness without heft. I\u2019ve made these dairy-free, but if you want to, you can easily use semi-skimmed milk in place of the almond milk. I want to make it as easy as possible for you to make these, as this is a particularly splendid specimen of muffin.",

    "tips": [
        "If you can\u2019t get the white spelt flour, which is magnificent in muffins, use 300g/10\u00bdoz plain flour and 100g/3\u00bdoz plain wholemeal (not bread) flour instead. These are best eaten on day they are made, otherwise store in an airtight container for 1\u20132 days. Reheat in an oven preheated to 150C/Gas 2 for about 8 minutes. Best served warm. To freeze, stack fully cooled muffins in an airtight container with baking parchment between the layers, or wrap individually in clingfilm then put in a resealable bag. Freeze for up to 3 months. Defrost on a wire rack for about 1 hour."

    "ingredients": {
        "default": [
            "225ml/8fl oz unsweetened almond milk",
            "2 Chai teabags",
            "1 tsp ground cinnamon",
            "400g/14oz white spelt flour",
            "2\u00bd tsp baking powder",
            "150g/5\u00bdoz soft light brown sugar",
            "75g/2\u00bdoz natural skin-on almonds, roughly chopped",
            "2 large free-range eggs",
            "150ml/5fl oz sunflower oil"
        ]
    },
    "steps": [
        "Warm the almond milk with the contents of the 2 teabags (I just rip them open over the pan) and cinnamon \u2013 stirring to mix \u2013 and leave to cool.",
        "While the milk\u2019s cooling, preheat the oven to 200C/180C Fan/Gas 6 and line a 12-hole muffin tin with paper cases.",
        "In a large bowl, measure out the flour, baking powder, sugar and all but 2 tablespoons of the chopped almonds, and combine well.",
        "When the milk has cooled, add the eggs and oil, then whisk well.",
        "Add the liquid ingredients to the dry ingredients, using a wooden spoon. Don\u2019t be too efficient about this: a slightly lumpy batter makes for lighter muffins. Divide the mixture between the muffin cases (it will fill them well), then sprinkle equally with the remaining almonds and bake for 20\u201325 minutes, or until a cake tester comes out clean and the muffins are slightly risen and pleasingly golden-brown on top.",
        "Remove to a wire rack to cool for about 10 minutes before devouring."
