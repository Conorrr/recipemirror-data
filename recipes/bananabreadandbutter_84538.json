        "Place slices of banana between the slices of brioche.",
        "Whisk the eggs, egg yolks and caster sugar together in a bowl, then gradually pour over the infused milk mixture, stirring constantly.",
        "Pour the custard mixture over the brioche and bananas and transfer to the oven to bake for 20-30 minutes, or until the custard is set and the brioche is golden-brown.",
        "For the caramel, place the caster sugar into a clean saucepan and heat without stirring until the sugar has melted. Continue to heat until the liquid becomes golden-brown, then pour over the bread and butter pudding and serve."
