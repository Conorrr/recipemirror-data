        "To make the filling for the spring rolls, heat a wok and add the oil. Once hot add the ginger, mushrooms, bamboo shoots and water chestnuts. Cook for a couple of minutes.",
        "Add the soy sauce, Chinese five-spice powder, beansprouts, spring onions and carrot. And cook for 1 minute.",
        "Add the duck meat, oyster sauce and finish with the toasted sesame oil. Transfer to a dish and let this mixture cool before using it.",
        "To assemble the spring rolls, arrange one spring roll wrapper so that the corners are pointing upwards, downwards and to the sides.",
        "Spoon 2 teaspoons of filling near the bottom corner about 2cm/\u00bein from the edge. (Make sure the filling is cool but not too wet \u2013 otherwise the spring roll will be soggy and you will break the spring roll wrapper.)",
        "Roll the wrapper over the filling, squeezing any air out as you roll away from you. As you reach the middle bring the 2 side corners to the middle, making sure they overlap. Continue to roll and tuck the top edge in and seal it with a little of the beaten egg.",
        "Repeat with the remaining spring roll wrappers and filling.",
        "Fill a deep-fat fryer or a large, deep, heavy-bottomed pan two-thirds full with vegetable oil. Heat the oil to 180C. (CAUTION: Hot oil can be dangerous. Don't leave unattended)",
        "Deep-fry the spring rolls in batches for 5-6 minutes swishing them in the fryer until golden-brown. Remove and drain on kitchen paper.",
        "For the barbecue dipping sauce, fry the onion and garlic in the oil with the chilli, fennel seeds and sugar. Add the soy sauce and ketchup and season with salt and pepper.",
        "Bring to the boil and simmer for a few minutes to combine the flavours.",
        "For the sweet and sour dipping sauce, put all the ingredients in a pan and bring to a boil and cook until it thickens, 5-8 minutes.",
        "To serve, place the spring rolls on a serving board or slate and pour the 2 dipping sauces in separate bowls and serve alongside. Garnish with fresh coriander, spring onions and fresh red chilli."
