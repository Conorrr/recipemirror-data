        "Melt the chocolate with the water in a bowl set over a pan of simmering water, stirring occasionally, taking care not to allow the bowl to touch the water. Heat, stirring, until the all the chocolate is melted.",

        "Pour the mixture into a large glass bowl, or into eight individual serving bowls and chill in the fridge for one hour, or until set.",
