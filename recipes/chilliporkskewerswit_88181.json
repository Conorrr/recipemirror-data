        "For the pork skewers, sprinkle the medallions with the chilli flakes and season with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Drizzle over the olive oil and skewer each one with a bamboo skewer. Heat a griddle pan and griddle the pork until completely cooked through, about 2-3 minutes on each side.",
        "Remove the skewers from the pan and add the soy sauce and Worcestershire sauce to the pan. Bring to a simmer and scrape up the bits to make a dressing for the salad.",
        "For the salad, combine all the ingredients in a bowl. Drizzle over the juices from the griddle pan and stir everything together to combine.",
        "To serve, place the tomato salad onto a serving plate and arrange the pork skewers on top. Serve immediately."
