        "For the cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e, preheat the oven to 150C/300F/Gas 2.",

        "In a heatproof bowl, whisk together the eggs and sugar until light and frothy.",
        "Add the boiled cream to the eggs and mix well.",
        "Pour the mixture into individual moulds placed in a roasting tin. Cover the base of the tin with water to make a bain marie. Place in the oven for about 30 minutes, or until they are set on the edges but still wobbly in the centre. Remove from the oven and set aside to cool.",
        "For the figs, preheat the oven to 160C/325F/Gas 3. Place the figs on a baking tray and sprinkle them with sugar and rosewater. Bake the figs for six minutes.",
        "For the brittle, line a baking tray with greaseproof paper. Place the sugar into a saucepan over a low heat. Once the sugar has completely melted, add the nuts. Pour the mixture onto the prepared tray and leave to cool.",
        "When set, break the brittle into shards.",
        "For the cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e, cover the tops with an even layer of caster sugar and caramelise using a chef's blowtorch.",
        "Serve the cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e with the figs and brittle."
