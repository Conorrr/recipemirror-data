        "For the chutney, place the star anise, cloves and peppercorns on a piece of muslin and make into a parcel, securing it with cook\u2019s string. Add to a large pan with the white wine vinegar, salt and sugar. Bring to a boil, then simmer gently.",
        "Put the remaining chutney ngredients into the pan with the muslin parcel.",
        "Bring to the boil slowly and then simmer gently until the sauce has reduced to a syrupy consistency.",

        "Bring all the ingredients together to form a dough (add a little water or more flour if needed).",
        "Roll out the mixture on greaseproof paper so it is 1cm/\u00bdin deep, then lift the greaseproof paper into a baking tin and bake in the oven for 8-12 minutes.",
        "For the filling, in a bowl mix together the spring onion, chives, rocket, watercress, soft cheese, salmon and lemon juice. Season to taste with salt and freshly ground black pepper.",
