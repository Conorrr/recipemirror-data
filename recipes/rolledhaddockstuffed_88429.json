Secure with a cocktail stick. Drizzle with olive oil and season with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Place in a steamer and steam for 6-8 minutes, or until cooked through.",
        "For the rice, heat the olive oil in a saucepan, add the onion and chilli and fry until softened but not coloured.",
        "Add the cooked rice and warm through. Add the chopped spinach, salt and freshly ground black pepper and stir over a low heat for one minute. Lightly oil a small ramekin and fill with the cooked rice, pressing it down. Turn out onto a serving plate.",
        "For the dressing, whisk all the ingredients together in a small bowl.",
        "To serve, place the rolled haddock next to the rice on the serving plate and pour over the dressing."
