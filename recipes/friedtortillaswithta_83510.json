        "To make the tortillas, heat the oil in a deep, heavy-bottomed saucepan until a breadcrumb sizzles and turns brown when dropped in it. (CAUTION: hot oil can be dangerous. Do not leave unattended!)",
        "Carefully place the tortilla triangles into the oil and deep-fry until golden, then carefully remove with a slotted spoon and drain on kitchen paper.",
        "To make the tapenade, place all of the tapenade ingredients into a food processor and blend to a coarse paste.",
        "To serve, place the tapenade in a small bowl in the centre of a plate with the tortilla crisps around. Garnish with the lemon wedge and a flatleaf parsley leaf."
