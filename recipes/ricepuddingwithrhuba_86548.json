        "For the rhubarb comp\u00f4te, melt the butter in a stainless steel pan before adding the chopped rhubarb, sugar and vanilla pod. Gently cook the rhubarb to a pur\u00e9e, stirring occasionally.",
        "Remove the vanilla pod from the pur\u00e9e, scraping the remaining vanilla seeds into the rhubarb before placing the pur\u00e9e into a blender. Blend the mix thoroughly before passing through a fine sieve. Return the pur\u00e9e to a pan and keep warm.",
        "To serve, place a large spoon of the rice pudding into the middle of a large bowl. Make a well in the middle of the rice and spoon in some of the rhubarb comp\u00f4te."
