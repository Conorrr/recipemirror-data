        "Meanwhile, heat a griddle pan until hot. Drizzle the olive oil over the squid and season with salt and pepper. Grill the squid and tentacles until lightly charred and the flesh is no longer transparent.",
        "Arrange the watermelon, olives and goat\u2019s curd on serving plates. Put the calamari and crisp vine leaves on top and finish with parsley leaves, a drizzle of olive oil and a final grinding of salt and pepper. Finish with the circles of melon rind."
