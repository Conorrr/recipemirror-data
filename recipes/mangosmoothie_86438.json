            "2 Indian Alphonso mangoes, in season from April (or use canned pur\u00e9ed mangoes)",
            "250-300ml/9-10\u00bd fl oz cold milk",
            "1\u00bd-2 tbsp sugar, or to taste, according to the size and sweetness of the mangoes",
            "ice cubes, to serve"
        ]
    },
    "steps": [
        "Stand one of the mangoes upright with the narrow end facing you. Slice off the 'cheeks' on either side of the stone and slice these in half lengthwise.",
        "Cut around the stone to take off as much flesh as possible, capturing all the running juices in a bowl.",
        "Remove the skin by peeling or cutting the fruit carefully off it. Repeat with the other mango. Discard the skin and pur\u00e9e the flesh and juice in a food processor or blender.",
        "Add the milk and sugar and combine until it becomes a thick smooth mass. Chill until ready to drink. Add the ice cubes and serve straight from the fridge. A little goes a long way, so serve in small glasses."
