        "Before cooking, wash your hands and put an apron on. Weigh or measure all the ingredients. Ask a grown-up to preheat the oven to 200C/400F/Gas 5.",
        "Brush some oil inside a small (500g) loaf tin. Line the bottom of the tin with some baking paper (parchment).",
        "Break the egg into a mixing bowl. Add the oil and whisk lightly with the fork until well combined.",
        "Put the flour and sugar into another bowl. Stir with the fork. This is the \u2018dry\u2019 bowl.",
        "Grate the carrot and stir into the egg mixture. Next add the pineapple and walnuts. This is the \u2018wet\u2019 bowl.",
        "Pour the contents of the wet bowl into the dry bowl and mix well with the wooden spoon.",
        "You\u2019ll need to ask a grown-up to help with this part. Pour the mixture into the loaf tin, place on a baking tray and ask a grown-up to put it in the oven for 25-30 minutes.",
        "Leave the cake to cool before tipping out and serving in slices."
