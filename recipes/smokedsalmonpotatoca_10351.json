        "To make the potatoes, peel and wash the potatoes.",
        "Grate the potatoes with a hand grater and season with the sea salt and flavour with the pepper.",
        "Place the peanut oil into 5 blinis pans and when the oil is hot cook the potatoes until golden brown (medium heat).",
        "Make sure to press the potatoes down with a palette knife so they cook evenly.",
        "Cook for about 5-6 minutes.",
        "To make the cream, whisk the cream with the horseradish, salt and pepper to taste, until it has thickened.",
        "To serve, place the potato on the plate and carefully place 3 slices of salmon overlapping each other on top. Take 2 spoons and make a quenelle of cream (the shape of the inside of the spoon by pulling one against the other), a dollop of cream will do for the centre. Then spoon on the caviar and garnish with flat parsley."
