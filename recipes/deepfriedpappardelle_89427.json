        "Heat the vegetable oil in a deep heavy-based frying pan until a breadcrumb sizzles and turns brown when dropped into it. (CAUTION: hot oil can be dangerous. Do not leave unattended.)",
        "Carefully place the fresh papardelle into the hot oil and deep fry for 3-4 minutes, or until crisp. Remove with a slotted spoon and drain on kitchen paper.",
        "Using a sieve, dust the papardelle with the icing sugar, ground cinnamon and ground mixed spice.",
        "To serve, pile the deep-fried papardelle onto a serving plate. Mix the Greek-style yoghurt with the maple syrup in a separate bowl and serve alongside."
