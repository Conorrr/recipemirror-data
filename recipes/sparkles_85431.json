        "Place half a small strawberry into each of four sections of an ice cube tray and fill up the tray with water to about 80 per cent full.",
        "Top up the cube sections with a small drop of strawberry liqueur (not too much as the alcohol won't freeze). Place into the freezer for 2-3 hours or until completely frozen.",
        "Place the remaining one tablespoon of strawberry liqueur into a Martini glass and swirl around the glass.",
        "To serve, place the strawberry ice cubes into the glass and top up with champagne."
