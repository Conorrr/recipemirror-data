    "steps": [
        "For the pasta, place the flour and egg into a food processor and blend until the mixture comes together to form a dough.",
        "Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and knead for 1-2 minutes. Wrap the dough in cling film and leave to rest in the fridge for 5-10 minutes.",
        "Roll the pasta through a pasta machine according to manufacturer's instructions until very thin, then cut in half to make two sheets.",
        "Lay one of the sheets on a lightly floured surface and place the three scallops at equal distances along the length of the sheet.",
        "Brush the pasta sheet all over with water, then place the second sheet on top, pressing any air pockets out and ensuring the two sheets are bound together.",
        "Using a 5cm/2in chefs' ring, cut around the scallops to make the three tortellini.",
        "Place the tortellini into a saucepan of boiling water with a little salt and cook for one minute, or until al dente, then drain and set aside to keep warm.",
        "For the sauce, heat the oil in a frying pan and fry the pancetta until golden-brown and crisp, then add the shallot and garlic and cook until soft.",
        "Add the brown sugar, tomatoes and vodka to the pan and cook until the sauce is thick, then season with salt and freshly ground black pepper.",
        "To serve, place the tortellini onto a plate, pour over the sauce and sprinkle with parmesan."
