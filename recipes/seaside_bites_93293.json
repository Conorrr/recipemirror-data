        "Before cooking, wash your hands and put an apron on. Weigh or measure all the ingredients. Ask a grown-up to preheat the oven at 200C/400F/Gas 6. Brush the inside of two dariole moulds or two parts of the muffin tray with vegetable oil.",
        "Roll the two slices of bread flat with a rolling pin, pressing down well. Then cut two circles 8-9cm in diameter with a pastry cutter.",
        "Break the egg into a mixing bowl, add a pinch of pepper and the milk and whisk up with the fork. Dip the circles of bread into the eggy mixture then push the circles into the oiled dariole moulds or muffin tray.",
        "Cut the trout fillet into small pieces with scissors (ask a grown-up for help with the scissors) and add them to leftover egg mixture. Then chop the chives with the scissors and add to the eggy mixture along with the horseradish.",
        "Put the moulds or muffin tray onto a baking tray. Pour the remaining eggy mixture into the eggy bread-lined cases. You may not need all the mixture.",
        "Ask a grown-up to place the tray into the preheated oven for 20-25 minutes or until they are golden-brown and the egg is set. Serve with a few tomatoes."
