            "200g/7oz Thai sticky rice",
            "1 x 400ml/14fl oz can coconut milk",
            "\u00bc tsp salt",
            "50g/1\u00beoz palm sugar, roughly chopped if from a block",
            "5 kaffir lime leaves",
            "1 ripe medium papaya, seeds removed, peeled, cut into 5mm/\u00bcin neat slices",
            "2 limes, zest and juice only",
            "4 sprigs mint, for garnish (optional)"
        ]
    },
    "steps": [
        "Soak the rice in 300ml/10fl oz of water for at least 30 minutes, but for up to four hours before using.",
        "Drain the rice and wash thoroughly.",
        "Line a bamboo steamer (with a lid) with either greaseproof paper, a banana leaf or a clean sheet of muslin. If using greaseproof paper or a banana leaf, pierce some holes using a skewer (don\u2019t make the holes too large, but you do want them to allow the steam through).",
        "Place about 425ml/\u00be pint of water (5cm/2in depth) into a saucepan or a wok and place the rice in the steamer. Put on the lid, bring the water to the boil and then reduce the heat to low-medium and steam for about 20 minutes.",
        "In the meantime, add the coconut milk, salt, palm sugar and kaffir lime leaves to a saucepan. Warm through over a medium heat - do not boil.",
        "Stir frequently for a good 5-7 minutes to infuse the flavours. Once infused, remove from the heat.",
        "Arrange the prepared papaya onto four plates or a suitable serving dish and pour over the zest and juice of the limes.",
        "Once the rice is cooked, put it into a mixing bowl and gradually add three-quarters of the infused coconut milk. Reserve the remaining quarter.",
        "Mix well and leave to cool for 10-15 minutes. Transfer the rice into individual serving bowls or a suitable dish and drizzle over the remaining infused coconut milk.",
        "Serve the papaya salad along with the rice. Garnish with a sprig of mint if liked."
