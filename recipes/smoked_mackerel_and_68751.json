        "Preheat the oven to 200C/400F/Gas 6.",
        "Place the potato wedges, olive oil, dried herbs, bashed garlic and a decent pinch of salt and pepper into a mixing bowl. Mix well with your hands to coat the potatoes in the herby oil. Tip into a large roasting tray, ideally in a single layer and place into the preheated oven. Roast for 35-45 minutes, turning now and again until evenly golden-brown, crisp on the outside and cooked through inside.",
