        "For the polpettone, mix the onion, parsley, carrot, parmesan, mince, one egg and garlic. Season with salt and freshly ground black pepper.",
        "Add another egg and mix by hand. Form the mixture into a rectangle, placing the slice of ham along the centre.",
        "Heat the olive oil in a frying pan. Beat the last egg, then coat the polpettone in the beaten egg and the breadcrumbs and saut\u00e9 in the olive oil until brown on all sides, about 10-15 minutes.",
        "Put the polpettone in a deep baking tray, pour the sauce over the top, season with salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste and cook in the oven for 30-40 minutes. To see if the meatloaf is cooked, insert a knife into the centre. If the juices run clear, it is ready. Serve."
