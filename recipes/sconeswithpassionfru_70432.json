        "To make the scones preheat the oven to 220C/425F/Gas 7. Sift the icing sugar, flour, baking powder and salt in a bowl, add the milk and butter and knead into a dough. Roll out to 3cm/1in thick on a floured surface, then using the rim of a glass, cut out 5cm/2in wide rounds and place on a greased baking tray. Bake for 8-10 minutes, until golden.",
        "To make the passion fruit curd, place the eggs, passion fruit and sugar in a bowl over a pan of simmering water. Stir continuously with a wooden spoon for 8 minutes, until thick, then remove from the heat and whisk in the butter. Leave to cool, then serve with warm scones and whipped cream."
