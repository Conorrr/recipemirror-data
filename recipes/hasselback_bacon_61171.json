        "Preheat the oven to 200C/180C Fan/Gas 6",

    "tips": [
        "If you would like to make these vegetarian, season the potatoes with sea salt, freshly ground black pepper and a little finely chopped fresh rosemary and drizzle with a little olive oil before baking. Make sure the seasoning is pushed inside the slices."
