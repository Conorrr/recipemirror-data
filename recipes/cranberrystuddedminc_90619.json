        "In a large pan, dissolve the sugar in the ruby port over a gentle heat.",

        "Bring to a gentle simmer and cook for 20 minutes, or until the fruit has broken down and has absorbed most of the liquid in the pan. (You may need to squish the cranberries a little with the back of a wooden spoon to incorporate them fully.)",
        "Remove from the heat and allow to cool a little.",
        "Add the brandy, almond extract, vanilla extract and honey and stir well with a wooden spoon to mash the mixture down into a paste.",
        "Spoon the mincemeat into sterilised jars and, once cool, store in the fridge for up to two weeks."
