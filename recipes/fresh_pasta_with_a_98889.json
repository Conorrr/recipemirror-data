If you're short of time you could buy fresh pasta and finish off the rag\u00fa in a slow cooker. Equipment and preparation: for this recipe you will need a pasta machine with a cutting attachment of your choice.",

        "Cut the pasta dough in half and pass it through a pasta machine at its widest setting. Repeat this process, decreasing the roller setting down grade by grade with each pass until the dough is thin enough to pass through your cutter.",
        "Add your cutter to the pasta machine and pass the pasta through the machine to make your shape. Dust the pasta with a little semolina.",
        "Repeat the process with the remaining dough, then place the shapes onto a plate and chill in the fridge until ready to use.",
