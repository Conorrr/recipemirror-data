        "default": [
            "450g/1lb soft cream cheese",
            "4 large free-range eggs",
            "1 vanilla pod, seeds scraped out",
            "225g/8oz good quality white chocolate",
            "225g/8oz cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche",
            "butter, for greasing",
            "55g/2oz biscuit crumbs, to dust over the buttered tin (use any type you love - chocolate digestives are good)"

    },
    "steps": [
        "Beat the cream cheese in a bowl until soft, then add the eggs one by one, along with the seeds scraped from the vanilla pod.",
        "Melt the white chocolate in a bowl set over a pan of gently simmering water, then fold in the cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche until smooth.",
        "Fold the chocolate mixture into the cream cheese mixture.",
        "Grease a 25cm/10in cake tin and sprinkle the base with the biscuit crumbs to cover. Pour the chocolate and cream cheese mixture into the tin and bang down on a firm surface to remove any air bubbles.",
        "Bake in a low oven, 150C/300F/Gas 2, for 45 minutes-1 hour, or until the centre is just firm.",
        "Allow to rest for several hours to firm up, before turning out and serving."
