        "To make the veal, dredge the veal in the seasoned flour and pat off any excess.",

        "Place the herbs and breadcrumbs into a food processor and blend together, then place into a bowl.",
        "Dip the veal in the beaten egg until coated all over, then dip into the herbed breadcrumbs to coat the veal. Repeat the egg and herb breadcrumb coating process.",
        "Heat the oil in a medium ovenproof frying pan over a medium heat. Add the coated veal and fry for two minutes on each side, to brown all over.",
        "Transfer to the oven and roast for ten minutes, or until the veal is cooked through.",
