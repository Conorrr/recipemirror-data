        "Brush a frying pan with a very small amount of oil and place over a medium heat. Add the pumpkin seeds, stirring frequently. They will expand and brown fairly quickly, and when this is done, place them in a bowl and add the salt, celery salt, freshly ground black pepper and paprika. This is delicious if the pumpkin seeds are reasonably fresh."
