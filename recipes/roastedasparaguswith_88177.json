        "Preheat the oven to 180C/350F/Gas 4.",
        "For the fragrant rice, heat the oil in a pan and gently fry the onion and garlic for 5-7 minutes until translucent. Add the turmeric and crushed coriander seeds and stir. Tip in the rice and stir to coat the grains with the oil, pour in the water and season with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Bring to the boil and cook for 10-12 minutes, until the rice is tender.",
        "For the roasted asparagus, drizzle the asparagus spears in the olive oil and season with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Heat an ovenproof griddle pan until hot and cook the asparagus until it starts to colour, turning often for about 2-3 minutes. Place the pan in the oven to continue cooking for about 5-7 minutes.",
        "To serve, place a spoonful of the rice onto a serving plate and arrange the asparagus spears on top."
