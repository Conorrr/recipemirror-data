        "default": [
            "1 head of Swiss chard, stems cut into 1cm/\u00bdin slices, leaves halved",
            "4 tbsp olive oil",
            "\u00bd onion, finely chopped",
            "1 garlic clove, finely sliced",
            "1 stick celery, finely chopped",
            "1 carrot, peeled and finely chopped",
            "1 x 400g/14oz tin chopped tomatoes",
            "1 x 400g/14oz tin chickpeas, drained",
            "1 char-grilled red pepper, skin and seeds removed, cut into strips",
            "8 lamb cutlets",
            "1 tsp finely chopped rosemary",
            "sea salt and freshly ground black pepper",
            "1 red chilli, finely chopped",
            "2 tbsp finely chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley"
        ]
    },
    "steps": [
        "Cut the stalks from the chard and chop roughly. Blanch both the stalks and the leaves in boiling water for about four minutes. Drain.",
        "Heat a tablespoon of the olive oil in a heavy pan, add the onion, garlic, celery and carrot and cook gently for 15-20 minutes until tender. Stir in the tinned tomatoes, chickpeas and pepper and cook for 10 minutes, or until thickened. Add the Swiss chard and cook for another 10 minutes.",
        "Place the lamb cutlets onto a heavy board, cover with cling film and gently pound out the lamb chops evenly with a rolling pin or meat mallet.",
        "When the chops are about 1cm/\u00bdin thick remove the cling film. Rub the lamb chops with a tablespoon of the olive oil so that they are coated, then add the rosemary, sea salt and black pepper.",
        "In a very hot griddle pan cook the lamb chops one minute on each side for juicy medium-rare lamb.",
        "Finish off by chopping a fresh red chilli with a small handful of chopped parsley, place in a small bowl with the remaining two tablespoons of olive oil. Drizzle this mixture over the lamb and serve with the inzimino alongside."
