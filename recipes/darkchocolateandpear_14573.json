        "Lay the filo pastry on a damp surface and cut into a square. Grease a dariole mould with butter and place the pastry inside so it falls over the sides. Place in a hot oven 200C/400F/Gas 6 for a few minutes.",
        "Melt the chocolate over a bain marie (simmering water in a pan, with the bowl of chocolate sitting over the top).",
        "In a separate bowl beat the egg mixture along with the double cream. Add the chocolate and mix together",
        "Chop up the pears into small pieces and place in the mould. Pour the mixture into the mould and serve."
