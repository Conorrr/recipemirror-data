    "description": "At the time of writing, I confess you will need to go to an Italian deli or specialist food outlet for fregola, the sun-dried and toasted Sardinian \u201ccouscous\u201d specified for this recipe. I wouldn\u2019t substitute regular couscous for the fregola, which is rather more like dense pasta peas than semolina grains, and thus most comparable to the larger Midde-Eastern or Israeli couscous which could be used in its stead.",

        "default": [
            "1kg/2lb 4oz small clams, such as palourde",
            "1 tbsp olive oil",
            "1 banana shallot, finely chopped",
            "2 cloves garlic, peeled",
            "\u00bd tsp dried chilli flakes",
            "1 tbsp tomato pur\u00e9e",
            "750ml/1\u00bc pint light chicken stock",
            "4 tbsp dry red vermouth",
            "200g/7oz fregola",
            "2 tbsp chopped parsley, plus more for sprinkling"
        ]
    },
    "steps": [
        "Soak the clams in a large bowl of cold water, and sort through them, discarding any shells that remain open or are cracked or smashed.",
        "Heat the oil in a large heavy-based pan that comes with a lid, then add the chopped shallot, stirring for a minute, grate in the garlic, and add the chilli flakes, stirring again over the heat so that it sizzles, though not long enough to let the garlic brown.",
        "Stir in the tomato pur\u00e9e, then add the stock and the vermouth and let it come to the boil.",
        "Add the fregola \u2013 it should be covered completely by the liquid \u2013 and let it simmer, still uncovered, for 10-12 minutes (or as instructed on the fregola packet).",
        "Check that the fregola is nearly ready and then add the drained clams and cover the pan with the lid. Leave to cook for three minutes at a fast simmer, then uncover the pan to check that the clams have opened. Any clams that, once cooked, stay closed should be discarded.",
        "Sprinkle in the chopped parsley and stir to let everything combine before ladling into four warmed bowls to serve, sprinkling with a little more chopped parsley as you go."
