        "Remove from the heat. Allow to cool slightly.",
        "Place the creamy mixture in a food processor and blend for a couple of minutes to smooth out any lumps. I use a hand-held blender to whiz the mixture which works well.",

        "The ice cream is quite rich so two small scoops for one person is ample."
