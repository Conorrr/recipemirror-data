    "tips": [
        "In this souffl\u00e9 recipe, steps 1-6 can be done in advance. If making the custard base ahead of time, cover it with cling film to prevent a skin from forming on the surface. Keep chilled, but remove from the fridge 30 minutes before whisking the egg whites to allow the custard to return to room temperature."
