    "steps": [
        "Before cooking, wash your hands and put on an apron. Weigh or measure all the ingredients. Ask a grown-up to preheat the oven to 200C/400F/Gas 6.",
        "Use the scissors to cut the cooked chicken breast and bacon up and put them into the bottom of the ovenproof dish. (Ask a grown-up for help with the scissors.) Tear up the mushrooms and put them on top of the chicken.",
        "Remove the tops and tails the green beans with your fingers, then snap into smaller lengths (about 2cm/1in) and add them to the dish.",
        "Put the fresh tarragon into a small bowl. Add the cream, then the stock powder. Stir in the flour then pour over the chicken and bean mixture.",
        "You\u2019ll need to find a grown-up to help you melt the butter in a small saucepan. Brush the squares of filo pastry one at a time with melted butter. Scrunch the filo pastry sheets up loosely and place them on top of your pie.",
        "Ask a grown-up to place the casserole dish on a baking tray and put in the preheated oven for 25-30 minutes or until the filo topping is golden-brown and crisp and the filling is piping hot. Serve with steamed carrots."
