        "Make the batter by sieving the plain flour and cornflour together into a large bowl. Whisk in enough fizzy cold water to make a batter the consistency of double cream.",

        "Dip each fig into the batter, then carefully place into the hot oil. Deep fry for 2-3 minutes until crisp and golden brown. Remove using a slotted spoon and drain on kitchen towel.",
        "Serve at once with scoops of vanilla ice cream."
