    "steps": [
        "Preheat the oven to 220C/425F/Gas 7 (200C Fan).",
        "Put the flour and baking powder into a large bowl. Add the butter and rub it in with your fingertips until the mixture resembles fine breadcrumbs. Stir in the sugar.",
        "Beat the egg in a measuring jug. Make up to 100ml/3\u00bdfl oz with the milk, then set aside a tablespoon for glazing the scones later.",
        "Gradually add the egg and milk to the dry ingredients, stirring it in until you have a soft slightly sticky dough",
        "Turn the mixture out onto a lightly floured surface and pat out until it is about 2cm/\u00bein thick. Use a 4cm/1\u00bdin fluted cutter to stamp out the scones. Make sure you don\u2019t twist the cutter or the scones will not rise evenly.",
        "Gently gather the trimmings together and pat out again to cut more scones",
        "Arrange the scones on the greased baking trays and brush the tops with the remaining milk.",
        "Bake for 8-10 minutes, or until well risen and golden-brown. Transfer to a wire rack to cool.",
        "To serve, cut each scone in half and top with strawberry jam and clotted or whipped cream."
    ],
    "tips": [
        "Once the scones are cool, they can be frozen. To eat, defrost at room temperature and then reheat in a hot oven for 10 minutes. The scone dough should be slightly sticky to give the best results. Don\u2019t over handle the dough or it will be tough and don\u2019t be tempted to roll it out too thinly or you won\u2019t get good deep scones. For larger 5cm/2in scones, bake for 10-12 minutes."
