        "For the tagliatelle, place the flour and the egg into the bowl of a food processor and blend the ingredients until they have combined and the mixture has formed a dough.",

        "Wrap the dough in cling film and transfer it to the fridge to rest for five minutes.",
        "Remove the dough from the fridge and roll through a pasta machine twice, or until a flat sheet of pasta has formed.",
        "Cut the pasta into five ribbons and place it into a saucepan of salted boiling water. Cook for 30 seconds and then drain off any excess water.",
        "For the sauce, heat the oil in a saucepan and add the onion and garlic. Fry the ingredients until they become soft and golden in colour.",
        "Add the broccoli, tomatoes, pur\u00e9e and water to the saucepan and mix the ingredients well. Cook for five minutes then season, to taste, with salt and freshly ground black pepper.",
