    "description": "Freekeh is dried green wheat, harvested while the grains are still soft, then sun-dried. It is very common in the Middle East and North Africa, and is used in the same way as bulgur, couscous or pearled spelt. It works well as an accompanying pilaf or a salad, in this case with pomegranate seeds, pistachios, mint and spring onion. Each serving provides 347kcal, 6g protein, 46g carbohydrates (of which 7g sugars), 18g fat (of which 3g saturates), 1.5g fibre and 0g salt.",
