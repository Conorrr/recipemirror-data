        "For the dressing, put the oil, white wine vinegar, balsamic vinegar, mustard, sugar and salt and pepper into a bowl and whisk until evenly combined and thickened. Taste and season accordingly and then add the dill.",
        "Finely slice the spring onions, celery and fennel and place in a large salad bowl. Add the dressing and toss well.",
        "Cut the cucumber in half lengthways, then cut across into thick slices. Tear the lettuce into manageable-sized pieces. Place half of the cucumber and half of the leaves in the bowl. Season and then top with the remaining cucumber and leaves. Season well and chill for up to four hours",
        "Just before serving toss everything together."
    ],
    "tips": [
        "Don\u2019t toss everything together until ready to serve, as the dressing will soften the leaves. The dressing can be chilled in the fridge for up to a week in a screw top jar. Just give it a good shake before using and add the dill just before serving. Use the best quality olive oil for the best flavour."
