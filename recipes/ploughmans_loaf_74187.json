            "70g/2\u00bdoz whole rolled jumbo oats",
            "500g/1lb 2oz bread flour with malted grains",
            "85g/3oz rye flour",
            "1 tsp salt",
            "1 tsp sugar",
            "2 sachets fast action dried yeast",
            "500ml/18fl oz bitter",
            "4 tbsp vegetable oil",
            "150g/5\u00bdoz mature Cheddar, cut into 1cm/\u00bdin cubes",
            "4 onions, chopped"

    "steps": [
        "Place the rolled oats into a dry frying pan over medium heat and toast until lightly browned.",
        "Mix the dry ingredients, including the yeast, in a large bowl then add the beer and stir to combine.",
        "Turn the dough onto a floured work surface and knead for 10 minutes, using a scraper to lift and turn the dough.",
        "Roll the dough in a little of the oil and set it aside in a warm place until it has doubled in size.",
        "Heat the remaining oil in a frying pan and gently fry the onions until caramelised \u2013 this will take about 40 minutes. Set the onions aside to cool.",
        "When dough has risen, knock it back on a floured work surface and knead in the cooled onions and the cheese. Form the dough into a loaf shape, place it on a greased baking sheet and set aside for one hour to prove again.",
        "Preheat the oven to 180C/350F/Gas4. Dust the loaf with a little more flour, cut slashes in the top and bake for 40-50 minutes or until the bottom of the loaf sounds hollow when tapped."
