        "Prepare the potatoes. Cook the potatoes in boiling salted water until just tender, then drain.",
        "Heat the oil and saut\u00e9 the ginger, lentils and mustard seeds until spluttering. Add the potatoes and stir well to mix, crushing them roughly, then add the curry leaves and salt. Cook for a further 2-3 minutes. Remove from the heat and keep warm. Add the chopped coriander just before serving.",
        "For the sea bass, fry the fish in hot oil, until crisp.",
        "Meanwhile, mix all the cresses together and dress with a little curry leaf oil.",
        "To serve, place the potatoes in the centre of warm plates and spoon the sauce around them. Place the fish on top of the potatoes and garnish with the cress salad. Drizzle with curry leaf oil to finish."
