Crack open the lid when all the guests are around, and savour the aroma of saffron, rose water and spices. Serves 4-6 as a vegetarian main course, or try it as a vegetable side dish for 8-10 people.",

        "Wash the rice and soak in cold water for 20 minutes.",

        "For the vegetables, place all the vegetables in a heavy-based casserole and add the marinade. Set aside for 15 minutes.",
