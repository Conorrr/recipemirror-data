    "description": "By swapping the traditional chickpeas for soybeans you almost halve the carbohydrate content in these falafels. Traditionally deep-fried falafels can be quite high in saturated fat so these are baked and served with a fat-free dip and roasted vegetables. This meal is low calorie and if served as four portions provides 363 kcal, 25.5g protein, 30g carbohydrate (of which 10g sugars), 15.5g fat (of which 1.5g saturates), 11g fibre and 0.3g salt per portion.",

        "Preheat the oven to 200C/400F/Gas 6. Pat the soy beans dry with kitchen paper to remove as much excess moisture as possible. Put the beans into a food processor and blend to a rough paste. Tip into a bowl, combine with the remaining falafel ingredients (except the olive oil) and season, to taste.",
        "Shape the mixture into golf ball-sized balls and place on a baking tray. Spray with a little oil and then bake for 15-20 minutes, or until golden-brown.",
        "For the vegetables, put the vegetables onto a baking tray. Spray with a little olive oil, and sprinkle over the smoked paprika. Season with salt and pepper and cook alongside the falafel in the preheated oven for 20 minutes.",
        "Meanwhile make the dip. Combine the cucumber with the garlic, yoghurt, lemon and mint and season to taste.",
        "Once the vegetables are tender and the falafel golden-brown and crisp on the outside, remove from the oven. Season the roasted vegetables with a drizzle of sherry vinegar and mix in the coriander. Serve with the yoghurt dip and a wedge of lemon on the side."
