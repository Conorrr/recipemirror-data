        "For the ginger scallops with Chinese greens, heat a wok or large frying-pan over high heat until it is hot. Add the oil, and when it is very hot and slightly smoking, add the ginger, garlic and spring onions and stir-fry for 10 seconds. Immediately add the scallops and stir-fry them for 1 minute.",
        "Add the rice wine, soy sauce, sugar, salt, and pepper. Continue to stir-fry for 2 minutes, remove the scallops from the wok with any sauce and set aside.",
        "For the chiu chow noodles, in a large pot of boiling salted water, blanch the noodles for 2 minutes or until they are barely soft. Drain well and toss immediately with sesame oil and arrange on a serving platter.",
        "Mix all the sesame sauce ingredients together in a small pot and bring to a simmer. Allow the sauce to cool slightly and toss with the noodles. Serve at once.",
        "To finish the scallops, wipe the wok clean, add the groundnut oil and heat over high heat. When it is very hot and slightly smoking, add the sliced garlic and stir-fry for 10 seconds. Add the Chinese greens and stir-fry for 3 minutes or until the greens have wilted a little.",
        "Return the scallops to the wok and continue to stir-fry for 3 minutes. Now add the sesame oil and stir-fry for another minute. Serve at once."
