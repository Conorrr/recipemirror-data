        "Prick the tough skin of the sloes all over with a clean needle and put in a large sterilised jar.",
        "Pour in the sugar and the gin, seal tightly and shake well.",

    "tips": [
        "You can make blackberry brandy in the same way, substituting blackberries for the sloes and brandy for the gin. Blackberries do not need pricking."
