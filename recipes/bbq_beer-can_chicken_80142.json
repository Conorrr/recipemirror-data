        "Rinse the marinade off the chicken and pat dry. Carefully smear the butter under the chicken skin and over the thighs and season with salt. Pour the 300ml/10\u00bdfl oz ale into the reserved beer can, then carefully place the chicken onto the beer can, so that the chicken is sitting upright, with the can in its cavity.",
        "Roast the chicken for 40-45 minutes, basting a couple of times. Remove the chicken from the barbecue or oven and set aside to rest for 15 minutes."
