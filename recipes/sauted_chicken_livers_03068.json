        "Heat the oil in a frying pan and gently fry the shallot, garlic and caramelised onions until soft. Add the livers, season with salt and pepper, and fry for 4 minutes.",
        "Pour in the vinegar and cook for 3 minutes, by which time the vinegar smell should have disappeared. To check the livers are cooked through, remove a piece of liver from the pan and cut it open; it should be moist but no longer bloody (a little tinge of pink is fine). When the livers are cooked, stir in the capers and parsley and remove from the heat.",
        "Toast the bread and cut each slice in half, making two triangles. Arrange on plates and top with the livers. Garnish with a scattering of red onion and chopped mint and serve."

    "tips": [
        "Take care to cook the livers properly \u2013 if they are undercooked there\u2019s a risk of food poisoning but if cooked too long they can be grainy and bitter."
