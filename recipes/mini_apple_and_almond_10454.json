    "description": "One of my favourite bakes is a recipe for apple cake I created many years ago. This is a version of the same recipe but made up into individual cakes, which could be served warm as a dinner party dessert or cold as a delicious picnic treat. Equipment and preparation: for this recipe you will need six 7cm/2\u00bein cooking rings.",

    "tips": [
        "Tip 1: If you don\u2019t have cooking rings you can make your own using small (200g/7oz) baked bean tins. Remove the top and bottom of each tin and grease with butter and dust with flour, taking care with the sharp edges, before filling with the cake mixture. Alternatively, you could use any straight-sided bun tins with a loose bottom. Tip 2: It is important to weigh all the ingredients accurately or a dip may appear in the top of the cakes due to the moisture in the apple. Tip 3: These can be made in advance and stored in an airtight tin for 3 days. The cooked cakes also freeze well."
