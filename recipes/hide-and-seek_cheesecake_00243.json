        "Divide the mixture equally among four ramekins, pressing each portion down into an even layer at the base using your fingertips.",
        "Divide the raspberries equally among the ramekins, putting them on top of the biscuit base.",
        "Whisk together the cream cheese, beaten egg, vanilla extract and sugar until smooth and well combined.",
