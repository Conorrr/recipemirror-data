        "Cut into rounds slightly larger than the salami, brush with beaten egg, and top each round with salami (two slices if very thin).",
        "Bake for 10 minutes or until the pastry borders are puffy and golden. Transfer to a wire rack - they will crisp as they cool.",
        "Serve the tarts at room temperature topped with a little dollop of pesto."
