    "steps": [
        "Preheat the oven to 180C/350F/Gas 4.",
        "Place the blueberries, almonds and bara brith into a bowl and mash slightly with a fork. Stuff the centre of the apples with this mixture.",
        "Heat the butter in an ovenproof frying pan. Place the apples in the pan and sprinkle over half the brown sugar. Once the apples start to brown on the bottom, transfer the pan to the oven to continue cooking for ten minutes, basting the apples with the butter and sugar from the pan from time to time.",
        "Remove from the oven and place back on a low heat. Pour over the white wine and simmer until slightly reduced, then stir in the cream.",
        "Sprinkle the remaining brown sugar over the top of the apples. Using a mini-blowtorch, caramelise the sugar.",
        "Transfer to serving plates and serve with the pan juices poured over the top."
