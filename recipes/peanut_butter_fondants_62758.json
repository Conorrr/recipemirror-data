        "Preheat the oven to 180C/160C Fan/Gas Mark 4.",
        "Melt the butter, peanut butter and chocolate in a medium saucepan. Remove from the heat and whisk in the sugar, eggs and flour.",

        "Meanwhile, line 4 silver rings (7cm/2\u00bein diameter and 5cm/2in deep) with baking paper and place on a lined baking tray.",
        "Pour the fondant mixture into a large piping bag and pipe the mixture into the rings (alternatively spoon in). Bake for 8-10 minutes.",

        "Carefully transfer the fondants to serving plates using a spatula, then remove the rings and paper. Serve with a good dollop of the ice cream alongside and scatter over the toasted peanuts."
