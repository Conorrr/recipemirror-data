        "Line a 23x30cm/9x12in traybake tin with cling film.",
        "Add the butter, sugar and golden syrup to a large saucepan and stir over a medium heat until melted. Pour into a large bowl, stir in all the remaining ingredients until well combined.",
        "Put the mixture into the prepared tin and spread with the back of a spoon into an even layer. Transfer to the fridge to chill, uncovered, for about 2 hours, or until firm.",
        "Remove from the traybake tin and cut into 18 even-sized bars. Keep in an airtight container until needed."
    ],
    "tips": [
        "If covered and chilled in the fridge, these bars can be made up to 3 days ahead. Chilling the mixture is so important, as it makes the bars much easier to cut."
