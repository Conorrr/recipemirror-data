        "To poach the egg, place the water and vinegar a saucepan and bring to the boil. Reduce the heat to a gentle simmer and swirl the water with a spoon to create a whirlpool effect.",

        "To make the hollandaise, place the vinegar, peppercorns, shallot and bay leaf in a small non-reactive saucepan over a high heat. Boil rapidly reducing the volume of liquid to about a tablespoon, then remove from the heat and allow to cool for one minute.",
        "Place the egg yolk into a large glass bowl and whisk in the cooled vinegar reduction through a sieve.",
        "Gradually add the melted butter, whisking vigorously and continuously. Season, to taste, with salt and freshly ground black pepper.",
        "To serve, place the avocado in the centre of a plate. Place the poached egg onto the avocado and pour over the hollandaise."
