    "steps": [
        "For the cod cheeks, blend the bread to crumbs in a food processor, then add the lemon zest and pulse again to combine. Tip the mixture into a shallow bowl and clean the food processor.",
        "Sprinkle the flour onto a plate and season with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Beat the eggs in a bowl.",
        "In batches, dust the cod cheeks in the flour, then dip them in the beaten egg, then roll them in the breadcrumb mixture until completely coated. Place each breaded cod cheek on a plate. Cover with cling film and chill in the fridge until needed.",
        "For the salsa, blend the peas, mint, chillies, lime juice and cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche in the food processor to a rough paste. Tip it into a serving bowl, cover and chill until needed.",
        "Heat the oil (and dripping, if using) in a deep-fat fryer to 190C. Alternatively, heat the oil in a deep, heavy-based saucepan until a breadcrumb sizzles and turns golden-brown when dropped into it. (CAUTION: Hot oil can be dangerous. Do not leave unattended.)",
        "Carefully lower the cod cheeks into the hot fat in batches, and fry for 2-3 minutes, or until golden-brown and cooked through. Remove from the oil using a slotted spoon and set aside to drain on kitchen paper. Repeat the process with the remaining cod cheeks.",
        "To serve, pile the breaded cod cheeks onto a serving platter. Place the lemon wedges and the bowl of pea salsa alongside."

    "tips": [
        "Tip 1: Cod cheeks are solid lumps of meat with a membrane running through them, which needs to be removed - ask your fishmonger to do this for you. If you can\u2019t get hold of cod cheeks, cod fillets will do. Tip 2: Both the cod cheeks and the salsa can be prepared one day in advance and chilled to make your dinner party run smoothly."
