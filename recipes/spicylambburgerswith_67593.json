        "For the burgers": [
            "1kg/2\u00bclb minced lamb (it's best not to use extra-lean mince as the fat will help bind the burgers and keeps them juicy when cooked)",
            "2 garlic cloves, crushed",
            "1 medium onion, finely chopped",
            "1-2 tbsp mango chutney",
            "3cm/1\u00bcin piece of fresh ginger, peeled and grated",
            "1 red chilli, de-seeded and finely chopped",
            "\u00bc tsp ground turmeric",
            "1 tsp coriander seeds, crushed",
            "1 tsp cumin seeds, crushed",
            "flaked sea salt and freshly ground black pepper",
            "oil, for brushing",

        "For the relish": [
            "6 ripe tomatoes, quartered, de-seeded and diced",
            "200g/7oz tub of Greek yoghurt",
            "bunch of fresh coriander, roughly chopped",
            "1 small red onion, finely chopped",
            "squeeze of lemon or lime juice"

    "steps": [
        "Place the minced lamb in a large mixing bowl and add the garlic, onion, mango chutney, ginger, chopped chilli, turmeric, crushed coriander and cumin. Season well with salt and pepper and mix by hand until combined. The burgers can be briefly mixed in a food processor until just starting to hold together, but be careful not to over-work the mixture.",
        "Divide and shape the mixture into 8-10 burgers. If you want to check the flavour, fry a small burger in a drop of oil before shaping the rest and, if necessary, add extra flavourings or seasoning.",
        "Place the burgers on a cling film-covered tray and keep them in the fridge to relax for at least 30 minutes. They're ideal made the day before cooking.",
        "To prevent the burgers from sticking, brush with a little oil before barbecuing over medium-hot coals for about 5-6 minutes each side.",
        "Mix together the tomatoes, yoghurt, coriander, onion and lemon or lime juice and season to taste with salt and pepper. Serve with the burgers, either inside the bun or as a dipping sauce.",
        "For a change, use diced, seeded cucumber instead of tomatoes, and try mint instead of coriander."
