        "For the strawberry pyramids, sift the flour and salt into a bowl, then use a knife to 'cut' the butter into it until well combined. Add the warm milk and bring together to make a dough (this is a special samosa pastry but you could use ready-made filo pastry if you prefer). Cover with cling film and place into the fridge to chill for 20 minutes.",
        "Place the chopped strawberries into a bowl with the lemon zest, sugar and cinnamon.",
        "Roll the dough out thinly and cut into six 15cm/6in circles. Cut each circle in half to make 12 semi-circles. Place a little of the filling mixture onto one half of each semi-circle and fold the dough over the filling, pressing down around the edges to make a triangle shape.",
        "Brush each pyramid with a little melted butter. Heat the oil in a frying pan and fry the strawberry pyramids over a medium heat for about 2-3 minutes on each side, or until crisp and golden-brown on all sides.",
        "For the mint yoghurt, mix the yoghurt and mint together in a bowl.",
        "For the basil syrup, heat the sugar, water and vanilla extract in a small saucepan over a medium heat until the sugar has dissolved. Remove from the heat and allow to cool, then pour into a blender with the basil and blend until well combined. Pass the mixture through a very fine sieve into a bowl.",
        "To serve, place two pyramids onto each serving plate and serve with a dollop of mint yoghurt and a swirl of basil syrup."
