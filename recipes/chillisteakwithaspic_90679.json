        "Rub the steak with the oil and season with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Heat a chargrill pan until smoking, then add the steak and chargrill for 1-2 minutes on both sides (for rare), or for longer if you prefer your steak medium or well done. Remove the steak from the pan to rest on a warm plate.",
        "Return the pan to the heat and deglaze with the wine. Simmer for 5-6 minutes, or until the liquid has reduced by about a third. Stir in the cream and chilli and cook for a further 2-3 minutes, then stir in half of the coriander.",
        "To serve, place the egg noodles on a serving plate and top with the steak. Pour over the spicy cream sauce and garnish with the remaining coriander."
