        "Preheat the oven to 200C/400F/Gas 6.",
        "To make the crepe mix, combine the egg yolks, flour, milk and salt. Whisk vigorously to form a batter.",
        "Place a crepe pan over a medium heat, add a small knob of butter to melt. Add a ladle of the crepe batter and swirl to cover the pan. Cook for one minute, flip over and cook for a further minute.",
        "For the souffl\u00e9, whisk the egg whites in a large bowl until stiff.",
        "Gradually add the sugar and continue whisking until light and fluffy. Stop when the mixture is thick enough to leave a ribbon trail when the whisk is lifted.",
        "Fold in the goats' cheese and clementine segments making sure to maintain volume.",
        "Spoon the souffl\u00e9 mix over half of the crepe and fold over to contain the mixture.",
        "Place in the oven and cook for ten minutes.",
        "To serve, slide the crepe souffl\u00e9 onto a warm plate and dust with icing sugar."
