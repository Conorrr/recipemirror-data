        "Soak a wooden skewer in a bowl of cold water for ten minutes.",
        "For the prawns, thread the prawns onto the wooden skewer, drizzle with olive oil and season with salt and freshly ground black pepper.",
        "Heat a griddle pan until smoking, add the prawn skewer and griddle for 2-3 minutes on each side. Squeeze over the lime juice, then remove from the heat.",
        "For the crisp noodles, pour the vegetable oil into a saucepan and heat until a small cube of bread dropped in sizzles and turns golden in 30 seconds. (CAUTION: hot oil can be dangerous. Do not leave unattended.) Carefully drop the rice noodles into the hot oil and fry for 1-2 minutes, or until puffed up and crisp. Remove from the oil with a slotted spoon and drain on kitchen paper. Season with salt and freshly ground black pepper.",
        "For the chilli oil, heat the oil in a small saucepan, add the chilli flakes and cook over a low heat for 2-3 minutes. Remove from the heat and leave to infuse until cool.",
        "To serve, place the crisp noodles onto a serving plate, top with the prawn skewer and drizzle over the chilli oil. Garnish with the lime wedges and fresh coriander leaves."
