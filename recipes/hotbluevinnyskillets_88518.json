        "Preheat the oven to 180C/350F/Gas 4.",
        "Place the flour, baking powder and cheese into a food processor and pulse to combine.",
        "In a separate bowl, mix together the milk, yoghurt and oil. With the motor running, gradually add this mixture to the food processor until a dough is formed, adding more milk if necessary to bind.",
        "Turn the dough out and knead briefly on a floured surface. Roll out to about 2.5cm/1in thick.",
        "Heat an ovenproof griddle pan until hot and melt the butter in the pan. Cut out discs of the dough with a pastry cutter and fry on one side until golden-brown.",
        "Transfer the pan to the oven and continue to cook until risen and golden-brown on top, about 7-8 minutes.",
        "Serve the scones on a board, scattered with parsley."
