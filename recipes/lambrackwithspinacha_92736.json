        "Preheat the oven to 180C/350F/Gas 4.",

        "Heat the oil in a large ovenproof frying pan, over a medium heat. Add the marinated lamb and cook on each side for 2-3 minutes or until golden-brown all over. Brush any remaining marinade over the lamb and transfer to the oven to roast for 10-12 minutes (for medium), or until cooked to your liking. Remove from the oven and set aside in a warm place for five minutes.",
        "Meanwhile, for the spinach and chickpeas, heat the oil in a frying pan over a medium heat, add the chickpeas and ground coriander and fry for four minutes. Add the spinach and continue to cook; stirring well, until the spinach has wilted. Season, to taste, with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Set aside and keep warm.",

        "To serve, place the chickpeas and spinach into the centre of four serving plates, cut the rack of lamb into individual chops and place one on top of each portion of the chickpeas. Drizzle over the cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche dressing."
