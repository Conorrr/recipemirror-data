        "Heat half the butter and olive oil in a small fry pan.",

        "Pour in the brandy and when the flame has died, remove the fillets from the pan and arrange on a warm plate.",
        "Pour in the cr\u00e8me de cassis and the stock and season well. Leave over the heat until the sauce has thickened and reduced.",
        "Meanwhile, form a small patty by combining the sausage meat, cranberries and chestnuts.",
        "Heat the remaining butter and oil in a small fry pan. Add the patty and fry for 2-3 minutes, either side.",
        "Finish the croutons by spreading them with p\u00e2te, then the red current jelly.",
        "Pour the cr\u00e8me de cassis sauce over the venison.",
