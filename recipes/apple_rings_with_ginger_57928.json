        "When you mix the tahini spread it becomes quite thick, perfect for a transportable snack. If you want to serve this as a starter do not mix the tahini spread as it will look prettier and you can use it as a dip. If you are prepping the apples in advance squeeze lemon juice over them so they don't go brown."
