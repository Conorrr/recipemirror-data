        "Pur\u00e9e the 100g/3\u00bdoz raspberries, icing sugar, pepper and wine in a food processor to form a coulis. Pass the coulis through a sieve and into a bowl. Roll the blueberries, raspberries and strawberries in the coulis. Preheat the grill to hot.",

        "Serve a portion of pudding with the sauce and arrange the fruits and a little coulis around the edge. Dust with icing sugar, to finish."
