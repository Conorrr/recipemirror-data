        "Preheat the oven to 180C/350F/Gas 4.",
        "For the roasted mango, score the mango flesh in a criss-cross pattern with a sharp knife and gently press out from the skin-side until it resembles a hedgehog. Place the mango hedgehog onto a baking sheet, drizzle over half the honey and then bake for five minutes, or until slightly caramelised on top. Remove from the oven, drizzle with the rest of the honey and sprinkle with cinnamon.",
        "For the sauce, place the coconut milk, cinnamon and sugar into a saucepan and simmer until slightly reduced and thickened.",
        "To serve, pour the sauce over the mango hedgehog."
