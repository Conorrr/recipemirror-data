        "To make the rosemary oil marinade, gently heat the olive oil in a pan over a low heat until warm then add the rosemary leaves, honey and shallots. Remove from the heat and set aside to infuse until cool.",
        "When the oil is completely cool, strain through a sieve and pour it over the lamb. Cover and place in the fridge to marinate for 24 hours.",
        "Pre-heat the oven to 180C/355F/Gas 4.",
        "Remove the lamb from the marinade and season, to taste, with sea salt. Heat a pan over a high heat and sear the lamb for 2-3 minutes, turning occasionally, until brown on all sides. Transfer to a baking tray and roast in the oven for 5-7 minutes, or until the lamb is cooked but still pink in the middle.",
        "Remove from the oven and set aside to rest for 10 minutes.",
        "To serve, carve the lamb into 10 slices and thread each slice onto a rosemary 'skewer'. Season, to taste, with freshly ground black pepper."
