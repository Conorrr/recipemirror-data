        "Preheat a small ovenproof frying pan in the oven to 200C/400F/Gas 6.",
        "Place the egg whites into a bowl and whisk until stiff peaks are formed when the whisk is removed from the mixture.",
        "Add the icing sugar to the egg whites and continue to whisk until the mixture becomes glossy.",
        "Place the blueberries, white wine, cornflour, vegetable oil and ricotta cheese into the bowl of a food processor and blend until the mixture has combined and has a smooth texture.",
        "Gradually fold the egg white mixture into the blueberry mixture. Mix the blueberry and egg white with a metal spoon until they have combined and the souffl\u00e9 mixture is light and airy.",
