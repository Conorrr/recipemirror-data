        "Place each strawberry onto a skewer and then dip the tip of each one into the melted chocolate. Twizzle each one to avoid any drips then place into the oasis. Repeat with each strawberry, leave them to cool and harden before serving.",
        "These can be made in advance and kept in a cool dry place, but not in the fridge as they loose their sheen."
