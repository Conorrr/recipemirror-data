    "steps": [
        "Heat the oil in a frying pan and cook the onions on a medium heat, stirring frequently, until softened and slightly coloured. The small amount of oil used in this recipe means the onions might stick to the pan at some point; add a splash of water if necessary.",
        "Add the ginger, garlic and green chilli and continue to fry until cooked and any liquid has evaporated. Transfer the mixture to a plate, spread out and allow to cool.",
        "Preheat the oven to 200C/400F/Gas 6. Bring a large pan of salted water to the boil and add the potato wedges. Boil for 5-6 minutes, then drain. Place the parboiled potatoes on a baking tray, drizzle with the oil, then toss to coat. Put the tray in the oven and roast for 20-25 minutes, or until golden and crisp.",
        "Mix the ingredients for the spice blend together in a small bowl and set aside until you serve.",
        "Put the minced beef in a mixing bowl, add the onion mixture and all of the remaining ingredients, and mix well. (Mixing makes the meat more malleable and smoother; the more you work it, it the smoother it gets.) Shape into four to six burgers.",
        "Heat a griddle pan, hot plate, frying pan or barbecue to hot. Brush the burgers with a little oil and cook: four minutes each side for a medium finish for six burgers, a little longer if you have made four larger burgers.",
        "Rest the burgers for a few minutes while you sprinkle the cooked potato wedges with the spice blend. Serve the burgers in buns, with the wedges alongside and some ketchup for dipping."

    "tips": [
        "If you don't have mango powder, you could add a splash of lemon or lime juice at the end for the potato wedges."
