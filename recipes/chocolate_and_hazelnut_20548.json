        "Preheat the oven to 200C/400F/Gas 6. Line a baking tray with greaseproof paper.",
        "For the \u00e9clairs, heat the butter, water, milk and sugar in a saucepan until the mixture is boiling. Remove the pan from the heat and beat in the flour all at once, until the mixture comes together as a dough. Set aside to cool slightly then beat in the eggs a little at a time.",
        "Spoon the mixture into a piping bag and pipe 16 \u00e9clairs onto a baking tray. Bake in the oven for 10 minutes, then reduce the oven temperature to 180C/350F/Gas 4 and bake for a further 7-8 minutes.",
        "Remove the \u00e9clairs from oven and pierce a hole in each to let out steam. Return to the oven for a further 5 minutes, then set aside to cool on a wire rack.",
        "Meanwhile, for the hazelnut filling, whip the double cream in a bowl until soft peaks form when the whisk is removed. Stir in the coffee and half of the toasted hazelnuts. Chill in the fridge until needed.",
        "For the topping, melt the chocolate in a bowl set over a saucepan of simmering water (do not let the base of the bowl touch the water).",
        "When the \u00e9clairs have cooled, slice them in half and fill with the hazelnut filling.",
        "Drizzle the melted chocolate over the \u00e9clairs and sprinkle with the remaining toasted hazelnuts. Chill in the fridge for 10 minutes. Serve chilled."

    "tips": [
        "Make sure you leave enough space between the \u00e9clairs to allow for spreading during cooking."
