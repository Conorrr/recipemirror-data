    "description": "This is a cheat\u2019s variation of the classic French tart and makes an impressive pudding to serve in the autumn with lots of cream or ice cream. Equipment and preparation: you will need a 20cm/8in round fixed base deep sponge tin at least 5cm/2in deep.",

        "Don\u2019t be tempted to use a loose-bottom cake tin or a springform tin as you will lose all the juices. It is a good idea to bake the tart on a baking tray in case the juices run out."

        "default": [
            "about 75g/3oz light muscovado sugar",
            "about 9 ripe large plums, halved and stones removed",
            "100g/3\u00bdoz marzipan",
            "1 x 320g/11\u00bdoz pack all-butter puff pastry",
            "ice cream, cream or cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche, to serve (optional)"

    "steps": [
        "Preheat the oven to 220C/425F/Gas 7 (200C fan).",
        "Sprinkle the sugar over the base of the cake tin in an even layer.",
        "Arrange the plums on top of the sugar, cut-side down.",
        "Roll out the marzipan thinly to a round slightly smaller than the tin and place on top of the plums.",
        "Roll out the pastry just a little bit bigger so that it is the width of the cake tin. Cut around the tin to make a circle, lay the pastry over the plums and tuck the edges of the pastry down around the fruit. Make a small cross in the top of the pastry to let the steam out.",
        "Bake for 25-30 minutes, or until the pastry is crisp and golden-brown and the plums are tender.",
        "Loosen the edges of the tart, then turn out onto a plate and serve with ice cream, cream or cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche."
