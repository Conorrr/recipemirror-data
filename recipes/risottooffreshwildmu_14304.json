            "350-500g/12oz-1lb2oz porcini/ceps (and/or other fresh wild mushrooms), cleaned and sliced",
            "1 medium onion, finely chopped",
            "125g/4oz butter",
            "350g12oz arborio rice",
            "1 litre/1\u00be pint good stock",
            "at least 110g/4oz fresh parmesan, or vegetarian parmesan-style grating cheese",
            "1 tbsp best olive oil",
            "salt and freshly ground black pepper"
        ]
    },
    "steps": [
        "In a large pan bring the stock almost to the boil and keep hot on a very low flame.",
        "In another pan melt the butter and sweat the onion until softened but not brown. Add the sliced mushrooms and cook for a few more minutes.",
        "Add the rice, stir well and cook until well coated and slightly translucent.",
        "Add a ladle of hot stock and let it simmer gently until absorbed by the rice. Add another, and so on, until the rice is cooked (15-20 minutes). As a general rule for risottos, you need four times as much water as rice, by volume. And the rice is done when tender but still just a tiny bit chalky in the middle.",
        "Check the seasoning and stir in the olive oil, remaining butter and a couple of spoonfuls of grated parmesan.",
        "Serve at once with the rest of the parmesan on the table."
