        "Put the pine needles in a large pan over a low heat and place a wire rack on top. Use a blowtorch to smoke the pine needles. They should be almost be on fire. Sit the pheasants on the wire rack and continue to smoke the pine. Cover with aluminium foil, with the heat still low, and leave for 5 minutes.",

        "To serve, on each plate, put some fried artichoke \u2018pebbles\u2019, a slice of pheasant breast, a chicory half on top and the sauce around. Decorate with some oyster leaves."
