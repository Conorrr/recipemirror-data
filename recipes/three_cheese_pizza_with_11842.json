    "steps": [
        "Preheat the oven to 450F/220C/Gas 7.",
        "For the pizza dough, place the flours, salt, sugar and yeast into a large bowl and stir. Make a well in the centre of the flour and pour in 650ml/1 pint 2fl oz of water and the oil, gradually mixing in the flour to form a soft dough.",
        "Tip out and knead on an oiled work surface for about 10 minutes or until the dough is smooth and elastic. Place it into a bowl, cover and leave to rise for two hours.",
        "Place a heavy baking tray or pizza stone on the top shelf of the oven to heat.",
        "When the dough has proved, remove it from the bowl and knead for a few minutes, then divide into 6-8 pieces depending on how many pizzas you want to make. Allow to rest for five minutes, then stretch each piece over your hands to form a disc about 5mm/\u00bcin thick.",
        "Place the circles of dough onto upturned floured baking trays or a pizza peel if you have one.",
        "For the topping, put the tinned tomatoes into a food processor and blend to a pur\u00e9e. Spoon the tomato pur\u00e9e thinly over the pizzas, scatter over the cheeses then drizzle over the oil. Season with sea salt and freshly ground black pepper.",
        "Slide a pizza off the baking tray directly onto the heated baking tray or pizza stone in the oven and cook for 5 -10 minutes, or until golden-brown and crisp. Repeat to cook the remaining pizzas.",
        "For the rocket and parmesan salad, place the rocket in a bowl. Pour the oil and balsamic vinegar into a small bowl and whisk. Toss the rocket in the dressing and mix in the parmesan just before serving.",
        "To serve, scatter the basil leaves over the pizza and drizzle with a little more olive oil. Serve with the salad."
