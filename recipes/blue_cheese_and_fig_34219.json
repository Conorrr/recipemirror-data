    "steps": [
        "Preheat the oven to 200C/400F/Gas 6.",
        "Brush two sheets of filo with butter and place on top of each other. Cut into 24 equal squares. Put the squares together in pairs on top of each other at a 45 degree angle to make a star shape. Press into the holes of a 12 mini-muffin tin. Repeat with the remaining pastry to make 24 mini tartlets.",
        "Bake in the oven for about 5-10 minutes, or until golden-brown and crisp. Transfer to a baking tray.",
        "Chop the figs into small pieces, and divide between the filo cases. Put the cheese, lemon juice and sage into a bowl. Mash down with a fork, season with pepper, then spoon blobs of cheese mixture on top of the fig. Sprinkle lightly with paprika.",
        "Bake in the oven for five minutes, or until the cheese has just melted."
    ],
    "tips": [
        "If the figs have tough skins, scoop the flesh away from the skin and chop. If figs are not in season use one pear, peeled and diced and then tossed in lemon juice."
