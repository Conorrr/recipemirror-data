        "For the strawberry ice cream": [
            "500g/1lb 2oz strawberries, hulls removed",
            "300ml/10\u00bdfl oz extra-thick double cream",
            "\u00bd vanilla pod, seeds scraped out with a sharp knife"
        ],
        "For the elderflower jelly": [
            "450ml/\u00be pint sparkling elderflower press\u00e9",
            "50g/2oz caster sugar",
            "5 gelatine sheets, soaked in cold water for 5 minutes"
        ],
        "To serve": [
            "1 peach, stone removed, flesh finely diced",
            "50g/2oz small fresh strawberries, cut into quarters",
            "small handful fresh basil leaves, preferably Greek basil"
        ]
    },
    "steps": [
        "For the strawberry ice cream, freeze the strawberry quarters in the freezer in a sealable food bag for at least 4 hours, but preferably overnight.",
        "Meanwhile, for the elderflower jelly, heat 100ml/3\u00bdfl oz of the elderflower press\u00e9 and all of the caster sugar in a saucepan over a medium heat until just simmering. Drain the soaked gelatine and add it to the elderflower mixture, stirring until dissolved.",
        "When the gelatine has dissolved, pour in the rest of the elderflower press\u00e9 and stir to combine.",
        "Pour the elderflower jelly mixture into a wide, shallow bowl or a lipped plate. Chill in the fridge until set, about 30 minutes.",
        "When the strawberries have frozen and the jelly is ready to serve, blend the strawberries in a food processor with the vanilla seeds and half of the cream for 3-4 minutes, or until the ice cream mixture is smooth and thick and the strawberries have started to freeze the cream.",
        "To serve, decorate the top of the jelly with the chopped peaches, chopped fresh strawberries and basil, then top with scoops of the strawberry ice cream. Serve immediately, with the remaining ice cream in bowls alongside."
