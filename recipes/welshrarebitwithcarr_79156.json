        "To make the chutney, heat the carrots in a small saucepan. Stir in the vinegar, sugar, parsley and peach pieces. Reduce the heat and simmer gently for 10-12 minutes, stirring occasionally.",
        "For the rarebit, gently melt the butter in a pan. Stir in the flour to create a roux. Pour in the milk, and stir continually to create a thick sauce. Remove from the heat and stir in the cheese until melted.",
        "Add the Worcester sauce, Tabasco, mustard powder and seasoning, and stir together, to create a thick, almost paste like mixture.",
        "Spread the rarebit mix onto the toasted bread and grill for 2-3 minutes, until golden.",
        "Transfer to a serving plate and spoon the chutney on to serve."
