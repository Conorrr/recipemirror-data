        "For the aubergine fritters, heat the oil in a pan and gently fry the onion and garlic for 2-3 minutes. Add the turmeric, tomato pur\u00e9e, stock, wine and sugar and bring to a gentle simmer for about five minutes.",
        "Meanwhile, heat the vegetable oil for deep frying in a large saucepan and heat until a small cube of bread turns golden-brown in 30 seconds. (CAUTION: do not leave oil unattended as hot oil can be dangerous.) Carefully add the aubergine cubes and fry for 4-5 minutes, or until golden-brown. Remove with a slotted spoon and drain on kitchen paper.",
        "Gently stir the aubergine fritters into the onion and spice mixture. Stir in the coriander.",
        "For the saut\u00e9ed spinach, heat the oil in a wok and add the spinach. Cook for 1-2 minutes, until wilted. Grate over the nutmeg and stir to combine.",
        "To serve, arrange the spinach into a ring on a serving plate and pile the aubergine fritters into the centre. Top with the yoghurt and sprinkle with paprika."
