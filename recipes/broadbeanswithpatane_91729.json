            "120g/4\u00bdoz baby broad beans, pods removed (podded weight)",
            "55g/2oz very finely sliced pata negra or similar high-quality Spanish cured ham, torn (the slices will be so thin that it should result in small shavings of ham)",
            "1 small garlic clove, peeled, finely chopped",
            "1 tbsp extra virgin olive oil",
            "splash sherry vinegar",
            "sea salt flakes and freshly ground black pepper"

    "steps": [
        "Cook the podded broad beans in a pan of boiling, salted water for 2-3 minutes, or until tender. Drain well, then refresh in cold water. When cool enough to handle, peel away the outer membranes.",
        "In a bowl, mix together the cooked broad beans, pieces of pata negra ham and chopped garlic until well combined.",
        "Drizzle over the olive oil and a splash of sherry vinegar, then season, to taste, with salt and freshly ground black pepper and stir well. (NB: Remember that the cured ham will be salty.) Serve immediately."
