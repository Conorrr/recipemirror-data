    "steps": [
        "Preheat the oven to 220C/425F/Gas 7, line two large baking trays with baking paper and grease them with butter.",
        "Toss the cheese and seeds together in a small bowl. Sit a 9cm/3\u00bdin chefs\u2019 ring or cookie cutter on one of the baking trays and sprinkle a small handful of the cheese mixture into it, in a thin layer. Carefully lift the ring off to reveal a neat-edged disc of parmesan and lay a lollipop stick on top, with the tip of the stick touching the middle of the disc.",
        "Repeat with the remaining cheese and sticks to make 10 in total (leaving about 3cm/1\u00bcin spaces between them to allow for any spreading during cooking).",
        "You should have a little parmesan left over, so use it to cover up the part of the lollipop stick resting on the disc.",
        "Bake in the oven for five minutes, swapping the lollipops to a different shelf halfway through. The cheese should be lightly golden-brown and bubbling.",
        "Remove from the oven and slide the paper off the baking trays and onto a rack to help speed up cooling. Leave to cool for 1\u20132 minutes, or until the lollipops have become crisp. Very carefully remove each one with a palette knife. I like to serve these stuck upright into a box with holes in the top."
