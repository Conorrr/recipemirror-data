        "Preheat the oven to 160C/320F/Gas 2. Grease and line a 8in/20cm square cake tin.",
        "Mix the flour, baking powder, mixed spice, cinnamon, brown sugar and dried fruit together in a bowl until well combined.",
        "Add the butter and crack in the eggs. Mix well, then add just enough milk to give a smooth batter. Pour the batter into the prepared cake tin.",
        "Bake in the oven for one and three-quarters to two hours, or until the cake is golden-brown and springy to the touch. A skewer inserted into the middle of the cake should come out clean. Remove from the oven and set aside to cool.",
        "To serve, thickly slice the cake and spread each slice with butter. Fry in a hot pan for one minute on both sides, or until golden-brown all over. Serve each cake slice with a slice of cheese."
