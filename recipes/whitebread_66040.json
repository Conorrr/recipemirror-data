        "Line a baking tin with baking parchment and mould the dough into a sausage and place in the tin.",
        "Preheat your oven to 220C/450F/Gas 6, then leave the dough to rise for a further 30 minutes to 1 hour. Place the tin in the oven for 35 minutes. Remove from the tin, tap the bottom with your knuckles - if it sounds hollow, it's ready. Cool on a wire rack."
