    "description": "Using dark rye or wholegrain bread for sandwiches rather than white will increase the fibre content. This high-protein open sandwich with salmon and quark cheese makes a quick and convenient low-calorie lunch. Try topping with cooked and peeled prawns instead of the salmon. With a GI of 49 this meal is high protein, low GI and provides 235 kcal per portion.",
