        "Preheat the oven to 200C/400F/Gas 6.",
        "For the poached eggs, fill a small pan with boiling water, add a dash of white wine vinegar and bring to a gentle simmer. Crack the eggs into a ramekin one at a time and gently place into the simmering water. Poach for 3-4 minutes, or until the whites have just set. Remove with a slotted spoon and drain on kitchen paper.",
        "For the roasted asparagus, place the asparagus into an ovenproof dish. Drizzle with olive oil, dot with butter and season, to taste, with salt and freshly ground black pepper.",
        "Transfer to the oven and roast for ten minutes, shaking the dish occasionally to ensure even roasting.",
        "For the dressing, heat the olive oil in a small frying pan. Add the chopped chorizo and fry for 1-2 minutes. Add the chopped tomatoes, season, to taste, with salt and freshly ground black pepper and fry for one minute.",
        "To serve, place the roasted asparagus onto a serving plate. Top with the poached eggs and pour over the dressing. Garnish with chives."
