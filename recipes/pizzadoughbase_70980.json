            "650g/1lb 5oz Italian 00 flour (strong white flour)",
            "7g sachet of easy-blend yeast",
            "2 tsp salt",
            "25ml/1fl oz olive oil",

    "steps": [
        "Make the dough: mix the flour, yeast and salt together in a large mixing bowl and stir in the olive oil and milk. Gradually add the water, mixing well to form a soft dough.",
        "Turn the dough out on to a floured work surface and knead for about five minutes, until smooth and elastic. Transfer to a clean bowl, cover with a damp tea towel and leave to rise for about 1\u00bd hours, until doubled in size.",
        "When the dough has risen, knock it back, then knead again until smooth, roll into a ball and set aside for 30 minutes to 1 hour until risen again.",
        "Preheat the oven to its highest setting.",
        "Divide the dough into six balls and roll each out onto a lightly floured work surface until 20cm/8in in diameter.",
        "Spread a little passata (or homemade tomato sauce) over each pizza base and top with your favourite toppings.",
        "Bake the pizzas in the oven until the bases are crisp and golden-brown around the edges and any cheese on the topping has melted."
