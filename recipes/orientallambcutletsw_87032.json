        "For the salad, bring a pan of salted water to the boil and blanch the green beans for two minutes. Drain.",

        "Add the drained green beans to the pan and fry for a further one minute. Set aside to keep warm.",
        "For the oriental lamb cutlets, heat a small non-stick frying pan and place the lamb cutlets, fat-side down, into the pan until the fat has melted and is crisp and golden-brown. Turn the lamb cutlets over and brown on the other side, until the lamb is almost cooked through.",
        "Add the remaining ingredients to the pan, stir well, and fry the lamb for a further two minutes on each side until the juices have reduced to half the volume.",
        "To serve, place the lamb cutlets on a bed of the warm beans and garnish with chervil."
