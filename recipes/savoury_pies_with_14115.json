    "description": "Every country has something like these little pies \u2013 Polish pierogi, Indian samosas, Spanish and Argentinian empanadas \u2013 and this is Norway's version, made with Jarlsberg cheese and caraway seeds for that special Norwegian flavour. We give these dix points! If you're a lazybones you could use puff pastry, but you'll end up with something that's more like a fried pasty. Try these as a great little starter or beer blotter.",

        "First make your starter mixture for the dough. Pour the lukewarm water into a bowl, add the sugar and yeast, then stir in 100g/3\u00bdoz of the flour. Mix well and leave the mixture to rise for 2\u20133 hours.",
        "Add the milk, salt, the rest of the flour, and the butter and egg then knead the mixture into a relatively firm dough. Leave it to rise for 2 hours.",
        "Meanwhile, make the filling. Heat the olive oil in a frying pan, add the onion and cook gently for about five minutes until translucent. Add the garlic and continue to cook for another two minutes. Stir in the ham, cheese, parsley and caraway seeds, then season to taste and set aside to cool.",
        "Preheat the oven to 200C/400F/Gas 6.",
        "Roll out the dough thinly on a floured surface and cut out 12 small circles. Use a glass if you don\u2019t have a pastry cutter. Place a spoonful of filling on to one half of a pastry circle, then brush the edges with the beaten egg, and fold the pastry over to enclose the filling. Squeeze the edges together and brush again with the beaten egg. Fill the rest of the circles in the same way.",
        "Place the pies on a greased baking tray and bake them for 12\u201315 minutes until golden."
