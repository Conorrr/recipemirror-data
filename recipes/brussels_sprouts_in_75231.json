        "If you can\u2019t get roasted hazelnuts roast your own in an oven at 150C/130C Fan/ Gas 2 for 15 minutes, regularly checking they don\u2019t burn. Then chop them up. Alternatively you can use whole cranberries, chopped chestnuts, sliced spring onions or chopped bacon. All of which you fry separately before adding to the sprouts."

        "Bring a pot of salted water to the boil. Wash and trim the sprouts and add to the pot. Cook for 5 minutes or until just tender. Drain well and set aside.",
        "Using the same pan, add the butter and cook over a medium heat until it turns nut brown in colour (don\u2019t take your eyes off it as it will burn).",
        "Immediately return the sprouts to the pan and stir to combine with the butter.",
        "Grate the zest of half the orange directly over the sprouts and then scatter over the hazelnuts."
