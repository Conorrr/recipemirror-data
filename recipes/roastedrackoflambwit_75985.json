    "steps": [
        "Preheat the oven to 240C/450F/Gas 9.",
        "To prepare the herb crust, break the bread into large pieces and place in a food processor or blender and turn into fine crumbs.",
        "Add the herbs and garlic and blitz for a further 30 seconds.",
        "Heat the oil in a large pan with the butter until foaming, but not coloured. Season the racks and add to the pan, skin-side down, and cook for 3-4 minutes on each side (for medium rare). Remove from the pan and leave to rest for 5 minutes.",
        "Place the racks of lamb, fat side up, on a chopping board, and brush the mustard over the racks, to apply a good coating.",
        "Press a generous handful of the herb crust over the racks and transfer to a medium-sized roasting tin and roast for 5-15 minutes, depending on how your lamb is preferred. Cover the bones with foil if browning too quickly.",
        "To make the jus, heat the stock and rosemary in a pan over a medium to high heat and reduce by half, stirring occasionally. Check seasoning, strain and keep warm.",
        "Slice the racks in half and serve immediately with aubergine pur\u00e9e and roasted fennel."
