    "tips": [
        "Tip 1: Lasagne sheets can vary in size, so you may need more or fewer sheets. Tip 2: Soaking the sheets of dried lasagne really helps to soften them so that they absorb the sauce better. You could also use fresh sheets of lasagne. Tip 3: The lasagne can be prepared up to 1 day in advance and cooked when required. Tip 4: The uncooked lasagne can be frozen. Defrost fully before cooking."
