        "Tip half the apples into a pan with the cinnamon and mixed spice, add a squeeze of lemon juice. Cook for 10-15 minutes on a medium heat until the apples are soft, stirring to make sure the apples do not stick to the pan (add a splash of water, cider or apple juice if necessary). Add sugar to taste if you think it is required.",
        "Roll out the pastry to form a square and cut into quarters. Score a 1cm/\u00bdin frame around each piece and dock the centre in several places with the point of a sharp knife. Spread a spoonful of the pur\u00e9e into the centre of each square, taking care not to go over the edges of the frame as this will prevent the pastry rising properly. Top with the remaining apple slices.",
        "Brush the frame with beaten egg and drizzle the apples with honey, butter and sugar.",
        "Bake at 190C/375F/Gas 5 for 12-15 minutes until the tarts are crisp and caramelised."
