        "For the cr\u00eape batter, sieve the flour into a bowl and make a well in the middle.",
        "Add the eggs, a pinch of salt and a little milk. Mix together to create a thick paste, then slowly incorporate the rest of the milk, stirring constantly, to create a batter.",
        "Place into the fridge to chill for 30 minutes.",
        "Heat a non-stick pan over a medium heat and add the oil. Pour in some of the batter and swirl it around the pan. Cook for one minute, then turn the cr\u00eape over. Cook for one more minute, until golden-brown. Remove from the pan and place onto a plate. Repeat with the remaining mixture until the batter is used up.",
        "Heat the grill to its highest setting.",
        "Lay the cr\u00eapes out onto a clean work surface. Place a layer of the spinach down the middle of each cr\u00eape, then a sprinkle of freshly grated nutmeg.",
        "Sprinkle the pine nuts over each cr\u00eape.",
        "Crumble the gorgonzola down the centre of each cr\u00eape.",
        "Fold each cr\u00eape up from the sides to cover the filling and transfer the cr\u00eapes to a large baking sheet.",
        "Add a few small pieces of butter to each cr\u00eape and sprinkle with parmesan.",
        "Place under the grill to cook for 1-2 minutes, until the topping is golden-brown and bubbling.",
        "To serve, place each cr\u00eape onto a separate plate and serve with wedge of lemon alongside."
