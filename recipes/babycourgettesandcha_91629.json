        "In a bowl, mix together the chanterelle mushrooms and courgette strips until well combined. Drizzle over two tablespoons of the olive oil and season with salt, then stir until the vegetables are completely coated in the oil.",
        "Heat a frying pan over a high heat. When the pan is smoking, add the courgettes, mushrooms and any remaining oil and fry for 6-8 minutes, without stirring, or until the water from the vegetables has evaporated and the vegetables have softened and are golden-brown. (NB: If the vegetables start to stick to the bottom of the pan, shake the pan occasionally during cooking.)",
        "When the courgettes and mushrooms are cooked, remove the pan from the heat and add the chopped garlic. Season, to taste, with freshly ground black pepper.",
        "To serve, transfer the pan contents to a soup bowl. Drizzle over the remaining olive oil and the lemon juice, then sprinkle over the basil."
