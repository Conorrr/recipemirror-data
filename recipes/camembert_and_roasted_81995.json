        "Preheat the oven to 200C/400F/Gas 6.",
        "Place the garlic cut-side down in a large roasting tin. Add the butter, oil, a pinch of salt, a couple of twists of black pepper, the honey, rosemary and bay leaves and bake in the oven for 40\u201345 minutes. After 30\u201335 minutes put a large cross in the top of the camembert and add it to the oven. Add the baguette to warm it up too.",
        "Once the garlic is soft, the bread is extra crunchy and the cheese is all soft and gooey, remove from the oven.",
        "Serve everything on a big sharing plate. Break off a piece of crusty bread, squeeze out the tender flesh of the garlic along with a healthy dose of cheese and smear it liberally over the bread."
