        "Cover the pan with the lid and bring the mixture to the boil, then reduce the heat until it is simmering. Simmer for about two hours, skimming off any scum that rises to the surface of the liquid from time to time. Set aside to cool slightly, then strain the stock into a smaller pan. Pick the meat from the chicken drumsticks and add it to the strained broth.",

        "Serve the chicken noodle soup in bowls with the chopped chives sprinkled over."
