        "Preheat the oven to 200C/400F/Gas 6.",

        "Add the cooked rice, stir well and season, to taste, with salt and freshly ground black pepper.",
        "For the chicken, place the cayenne pepper, paprika, oil, lemon juice and chilli flakes into a bowl and mix together well.",
        "Add the chicken breast, turn in the spice mixture to coat and leave to marinate for 10 minutes.",
        "Heat an ovenproof griddle pan until smoking. Rub off the marinade and chargrill the chicken breast for two minutes on each side, until brown griddle marks appear. Transfer to the oven and cook for 10-12 minutes, or until completely cooked through (the juices should run clear when the breast is pierced with a skewer).",
        "Remove the chicken from the oven and slice the chicken into bite-sized pieces.",
        "To serve, place the chicken on a warm plate with the red rice alongside. Garnish the red rice with the grated Manchego, garnish the chicken with the Greek yoghurt."
