        "Preheat the oven to 200C/400F/Gas 6.",

        "Roast in oven for 25-30 minutes until golden brown and tender, stirring occasionally.",
        "Meanwhile, heat the remaining tablespoon of oil in a large heavy-based saucepan, stir in the onion, carrots, celery, garlic and thyme leaves and fry for 4-5 minutes until softened but not browned.",
        "Add the roasted swede to the pan and pour over the stock.",
        "Bring gently to the boil, cover and simmer for 25-30 minutes, stirring occasionally.",
