        "Preheat the oven to 200C/400F/Gas 6. Mix the flour, yeast, salt and water in a bowl with your hands until it becomes a soft, pliable dough.",
        "Place the dough on to a lightly floured, flat surface and knead for five minutes. Put the dough back in the bowl and leave to rise for an hour.",
        "Bring the dough out and mix the sultanas and walnuts into it.",
        "Shape the dough into a loaf, and roll the loaf in flaked almonds.",
        "With a sharp knife, cut a line down the centre of the loaf.",
        "Bake for 30 minutes, or until golden brown. Cool on a wire rack, serve toasted or with Stilton on the side."
