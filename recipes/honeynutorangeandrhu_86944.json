        "Preheat the oven to 200C/400F/Gas 6.",
        "In a food processor, blend the flour and butter together until the mixture resembles breadcrumbs.",
        "Add the sugar and salt to the food processor and pulse again until combined.",
        "In a small bowl, mix the egg with the cold water and gradually add enough liquid to the flour mixture to form a soft but not sticky dough.",
        "Place the dough onto a clean, lightly-floured surface and briefly knead the dough until smooth.",
        "With a clean, lightly-floured rolling pin, roll the dough into a rectangle shape 0.5cm/\u00bcin thick and trim the edges.",
        "Lay the pastry on a non-stick baking tray and sprinkle over the nuts, honey, rhubarb and caster sugar, leaving a border of pastry 1cm/\u00bdin wide around the edges.",
        "Bake in the oven for 12-15 minutes, or until the pastry is crisp and golden-brown.",
        "To serve, arrange the orange segments in a row down the centre of the tart and drizzle with the double cream."
