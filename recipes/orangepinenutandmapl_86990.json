        "Preheat the oven to 200C/400F/Gas 6.",
        "For the tray bake, grease a non-stick 30cm x 12cm/12 x 5in Swiss roll tin with butter.",
        "Place the butter and sugar into a food processor and blend until light and fluffy.",
        "Add the flour and pulse briefly, then crack in the eggs, one by one, blending between each addition to make a batter. Stir in the pine nuts.",
        "Arrange the orange slices along the centre of the baking tin so that they overlap. Drizzle with two tablespoons of the maple syrup.",
        "Pour the batter into the tray and smooth over with a wet spatula. Bake in the oven for 12-15 minutes, or until risen and set. Turn out onto a wire rack and allow to cool.",
        "For the vanilla cream, whisk the cream in a large bowl until soft peaks form when the whisk is removed. Stir in the vanilla seeds.",
        "To serve, cut the tray bake into squares, drizzle with the remaining maple syrup and serve with spoonfuls of vanilla cream."
