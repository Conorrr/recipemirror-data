    "description": "Cooking beef brisket in the slow cooker makes it really tender and a creamy bean mash is the perfect accompaniment. If you are making this recipe to serve two, make half the mash as, unlike the beef, it won't freeze well. Equipment: you need a slow cooker and a blender to make this recipe.",
