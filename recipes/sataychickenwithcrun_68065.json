        "Pierce the chicken drumsticks several times each with a sharp knife and place in a non-metallic bowl.",
        "Mix all the marinade ingredients together and stir into the chicken. Leave to marinate for at least 2 hours, or overnight if you can, turning occasionally.",
        "Preheat the oven to 200C/400F/Gas 6.",
        "To make the sauce, place all the ingredients, except the coriander, in a small pan and bring to a simmer. Cook for a couple of minutes, stirring occasionally, until thickened. Transfer to a small bowl that's the right size for dipping the chicken drumsticks into, and leave to cool to room temperature. If you're using it, stir in the coriander just before serving.",
        "Transfer the chicken pieces into a roasting tray with the marinade. Place in the oven for about 30 minutes, turning occasionally until golden and thoroughly cooked through. To check they're cooked, pierce with a skewer: if the juices run clear, they're done; if the juices are still slightly pink, return to the oven for a further 10 minutes. Serve straight away with the crunchy peanut sauce."
