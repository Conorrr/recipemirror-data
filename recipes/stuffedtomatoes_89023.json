        "Preheat the oven to 180C/350F/Gas 4.",

        "Place the hollowed tomatoes onto a baking sheet and drizzle over the honey.",
        "Mix the Stilton with the scooped out tomato flesh, then use the mixture to stuff the tomatoes. Drizzle over the olive oil and bake in the oven for 5-6 minutes, or until the stuffing is golden-brown.",
        "To serve, transfer the tomatoes onto serving plates and scatter over the chopped walnuts."
