            "4 small globe artichokes",
            "2 tbsp olive oil",
            "1 garlic clove, finely sliced",
            "1 tbsp chopped parsley",
            "2 tbsp double cream",

    "steps": [
        "Remove the outer leaves of the artichokes and cut the top off. Using a sharp knife, trim off any green, tough parts so you are left with the tender leaves and stem. Slice the artichokes in half and cut into fine slices.",
        "Heat the olive oil in a frying pan and gently cook the artichoke and garlic for two minutes. Add four tablespoons of water, cover with a lid and cook for four minutes, or until the artichokes are tender.",
        "When the artichokes are cooked, add the parsley and cream and season with salt and pepper.",
        "In a pan of boiling salted water, cook the tagliarini for about three minutes or until al dente. Using a pair of tongs, transfer the tagliarini to the frying pan containing the artichokes. Add a couple of tablespoons of pasta water and half of the grated parmesan to the frying pan. Toss well and grate a little truffle into the pasta. Check the seasoning and add salt and pepper as required. Toss again so the truffle is absorbed into the sauce.",
        "Serve in hot bowls with more truffle slices and the remaining parmesan on top."
