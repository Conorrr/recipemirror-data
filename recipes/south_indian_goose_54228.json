        "For the spice mixture, roast all the spices in a dry frying pan until fragrant. Grind the spices to a coarse powder using a food processor or a mortar and pestle.",
        "For the goose, heat a frying pan until hot and sear the goose breast, skin-side down, for 3-4 minutes, or the skin is crisp. Season with a little salt, then turn over and fry for another 1-2 minutes. Set aside to rest for five minutes, then slice thinly (the goose will be medium-rare).",
        "Heat the oil in a frying pan and add the ginger, garlic, green chillies, curry leaves and onions and fry for a minute, or until the onions are coloured but still crunchy.",
        "Stir in the remaining salt, turmeric, ground spice mixture and grated coconut and cook for a further minute. Stir in the goose breast slices.",
        "Reduce the heat, stir in the coconut milk and sugar and cook until the liquid evaporates and the meat pieces are evenly coated with the spices.",
        "Sprinkle over the coriander leaves and squeeze in the lime juice.",
        "Meanwhile, for the layered parathas, mix the chapatti flour, salt, oil and water together to make a smooth dough, cover with a damp cloth or cling film and set aside to rest for 15 minutes.",
        "Divide the dough in eight pieces and shape each into a smooth round ball.",
        "Dust a work surface with flour and roll each ball into a 7.5cm/3in circle. Spread the circle with a little ghee or oil, sprinkle with the seeds and dust with a little flour.",
        "Fold the circle in half and repeat the layer of ghee, seeds and flour. Fold the circle in half again, then carefully roll the dough out to a 3mm/\u215bin thickness.",
        "Repeat with the remaining dough balls.",
        "Heat a frying pan until hot and fry the paratha for 2-3 minutes, then carefully turn it over, brush with a little more ghee and fry for a further 2-3 minutes. Trun the paratha over again and brush the other side with a little ghee.",
        "Remove the paratha from the pan and repeat with the remaining dough."
