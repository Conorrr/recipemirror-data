        "Using a pestle and mortar (or a food processor) blend all the marinade ingredients together to a smooth paste. Brush the marinade onto the chicken, cover and leave on a baking tray in the fridge, for at least an hour, preferably overnight.",
        "Preheat the oven to 220C/425F/Gas 7. Cook the chicken for 20-25 minutes, or until golden-brown and cooked through. Leave to rest, then divide the chicken into four pieces.",
        "For the quinoa salad, heat the rapeseed oil in a frying pan and fry the pumpkin and sunflower seeds until golden-brown. Set aside.",
        "Combine the quinoa, olives, preserved lemon, broad beans, parsley and mint in a bowl. Tip in the cooled seeds and season with salt and freshly ground black pepper.",
        "For the dressing, whisk all the dressing ingredients together in a small bowl and pour over the quinoa salad and the chicken.",

    "tips": [
        "Spatchcocking means to split open and flatten out a bird for grilling or barbecuing. This speeds up the cooking time and ensures more even cooking. Watch our technique video linked from this page to learn how to do this, or alternatively ask your butcher to do it."
