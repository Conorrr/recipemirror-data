        "Preheat the oven to 180C/350F/Gas 4.",
        "Place the pork medallions between two sheets of cling film and flatten out to the thickness of a pound coin, using a meat mallet or rolling pin. Remove the cling film and season with salt and freshly ground black pepper.",
        "Heat the oil in a frying pan and fry the medallions for 3-4 minutes on both sides, or until golden-brown all over and cooked through. Set aside on a warm plate to rest.",
        "For the chips, place the potato pieces into a roasting tin, drizzle with the olive oil and season with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Transfer to the oven to roast for 12-15 minutes, turning the potatoes occasionally to ensure they brown evenly.",
        "For the salad, combine all of the salad ingredients together in a bowl.",
        "To serve, place the pork medallions on a serving plate with the chips and salad alongside."
