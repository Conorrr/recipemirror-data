        "Preheat the oven to 180C/350F/Gas 4. Grease a large baking dish with butter.",

        "Use 50g/2oz of the chocolate and hazelnut spread to spread the reserved brioche cubes and place them into the baking dish.",
        "Add the banana slices and chocolate and mix until well combined.",
        "Heat the remaining chocolate and hazelnut spread, milk and cream in a saucepan, stirring continuously until well combined.",
        "Meanwhile, whisk the eggs and sugar together in a large bowl. Whisk in the cream mixture until well combined.",
        "Pour the chocolate custard over the bread mixture and set aside for 30 minutes, pressing the bread into the custard occasionally.",
        "Bake the pudding in the oven for 10 minutes, then sprinkle over the breadcrumb mixture and bake for a further 25 minutes, or until golden-brown and the custard has just set.",
        "Remove the pudding from the oven and set aside to stand for at least 10 minutes."

        "Try making this pudding ahead as it\u2019s best served warm, rather than straight from the oven."
