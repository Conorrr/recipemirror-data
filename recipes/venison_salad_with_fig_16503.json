        "To make the vinaigrette, mix together all the ingredients.",
        "For the fig pur\u00e9e, cut the figs in half and remove the pulp, with no white flesh.",

        "In a blender, blend until smooth, then pass through a sieve. Finish with a little more butter and season with salt and pepper. Set aside and keep warm.",
        "Season the venison with salt and pepper. Heat a thick bottomed pan with a little oil and 25g/1oz butter. When the butter is foaming, add the venison and cook slowly, colouring all around. Cook for approximately 10 minutes, remove from the pan and leave to rest for 15 minutes before serving.",
        "For the rago\u00fbt, using the pan that you cooked the meat in, add a knob of butter and the shallots cooking gently for about 1 minute before adding the mushrooms. Add the chicken stock and cook for 2 minutes. Whisk in the remaining 25g/1oz of butter. Add some vinaigrette to taste and finish with salt, pepper, chopped parsley and a pinch of five spice.",
        "To serve, slice the venison. Put a little fig pur\u00e9e on each plate, put the mushrooms in the middle of the plate and meat on top. Dress the salad leaves lightly in the vinaigrette and scatter them over and around. Pour over a little rago\u00fbt and serve ."
