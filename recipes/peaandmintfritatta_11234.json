Place in a pestle and mortar with roughly chopped mint (reserving a few leaves for garnishing) and grated pecorino and pound to a paste. Add some salt, a little parmesan cheese, a squeeze of lemon juice and the olive oil.",
        "Melt the butter in a non-stick, ovenproof frying pan. Break the eggs into a bowl, mix lightly, add a splash of water and season. Add the mixture to the pan and then fold in some of the pea mix, stirring once or twice.",
        "Place the cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche in the middle and bake in the oven for 3 minutes. Slide onto a plate and serve sprinkled with the reserved mint and the remaining parmesan."
