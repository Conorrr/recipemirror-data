        "Leave the batter to stand for 30 minutes.",
        "Heat dripping in Yorkshire pudding tins until very hot. The fat should be so hot that when the batter is poured in it sizzles.",
        "Sprinkle a few drops of cold water into the batter and pour into the hot fat (this creates steam helping the batter to rise).",
        "Cook for 15-20 minutes in a preheated oven 220C/425F/Gas 7, until puffed and golden with a soft centre.",
        "Remove from oven and serve immediately."
