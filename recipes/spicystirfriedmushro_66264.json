        "Heat a wok or large frying pan until very hot. Add the oil and when it's very hot and slightly smoking, add the garlic, ginger and spring onions and stir-fry for about 20 seconds.",
        "Add the mushrooms and stir-fry for about 30 seconds.",
        "Quickly add the rest of the ingredients except the sesame oil.",
        "Continue to stir-fry for about 5 minutes or until the mushrooms are cooked through and have absorbed all the spices and seasonings.",
        "Just before serving, add the sesame oil and give the mixture a couple of quick stirs. Turn it on to a warm serving dish and serve at once, as the mushrooms are particularly delicious when hot."
