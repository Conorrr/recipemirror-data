        "Sift and beat the flour and baking powder into the butter mixture in batches until smooth, then spoon into the prepared tin and bake for 50-60 minutes (for a large cake). Keep a careful eye toward the end of the cooking time, and cover with foil if the cake is getting too dark. For cupcakes, fill the papers about three-quarters full then bake for about 20-25 minutes."
