    "steps": [
        "Prepare the mushrooms by brushing off any dirt, trimming the stems and tearing any large ones in half.",
        "Pour the stock into a saucepan with the trimmings/stalks from the mushrooms and warm through.",
        "Heat a large frying pan or saut\u00e9 pan until medium-hot. Add a knob of butter, the shallots and garlic and gently fry for a couple of minutes before adding the rice. Stir well, then add the wine and cook until the liquid has been absorbed.",
        "Add a couple of ladlefuls of stock at a time, simmering between each addition until the rice has absorbed all the stock. Repeat until all the stock has been used and the rice is tender - it should take about 12-15 minutes.",
        "While the rice cooks, heat a non-stick frying pan until hot. Add the remaining butter and a tablespoon of olive oil, add the mushrooms and cook over a high heat until just golden-brown and tender.",
        "Add the mushrooms to the risotto and stir through, then stir in the teriyaki sauce, mascarpone and parmesan.",
        "Pour the milk into a saucepan with the lime leaves and lecithin and bring just to a simmer. Blend with a stick blender to create a foam.",
        "Wipe the pan out, return it to the heat and add the last of the olive oil. Cook the red mullet skin-side down for a minute before turning over and cooking for another 30 seconds on the flesh side.",
        "Spoon the risotto into serving bowls, top with a fillet of red mullet, skin-side up, and finish with a spoonful of lime leaf foam."
