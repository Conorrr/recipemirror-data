        "Preheat the oven to 200C/400F/Gas 6.",
        "Place the butter and all the dry ingredients for the scones in a food processor and blitz until the mixture resembles coarse breadcrumbs.",
        "With the motor running, add the egg and enough milk to make a soft but not sticky dough.",
        "Tip out onto a lightly floured surface and add the raisins. Knead briefly to work the raisins into the dough. Roll out the dough and, using a floured cutter, cut out six discs.",
        "Place the scones on a lightly floured baking tray and bake for 12 minutes or until cooked through. Cool slightly on a wire rack.",
        "Stir the vanilla seeds through the whipped cream and chill until required. Serve with the raisin scones."
