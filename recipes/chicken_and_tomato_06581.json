        "Using a pastry brush, dab water around the edges of each pastry circle.",
        "Divide the filling mixture equally among the four pastry circles.",
        "Fold each pastry circle over itself to create four parcels, pinching the edges together to seal. Place each parcel onto a baking tray and dab with a little more water. Prick each parcel with a fork.",
        "Bake the chicken and tomato smiles in the oven for 12-15 minutes, or until the pastry is golden-brown and the filling is piping hot. Set aside to cool slightly before serving."
