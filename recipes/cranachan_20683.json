            "75g/2\u00bdfl oz porridge oats",

            "300ml/10fl oz double cream",
            "150g/5\u00bdoz half-fat cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche",
            "\u00bd tsp vanilla extract",
            "3 tbsp whisky",
            "3 tbsp clear honey, plus extra for drizzling",
            "400g/14oz fresh raspberries",
            "2-3 tbsp caster sugar"

    },
    "steps": [
        "Put the oats and almonds in a large non-stick frying pan and dry-fry over a medium heat for 4-5 minutes, stirring occasionally until light golden-brown. Remove from the heat and leave to cool.",
        "Pour the double cream and cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche into a large bowl and add the vanilla extract, whisky and honey. Whisk with an electric whisk until floppy peaks form. Don\u2019t over-whisk the cream as it will stiffen further when mixed with the oats.",
        "Put half of the raspberries into a sieve over a clean bowl and press with a ladle to make a vibrant pink pur\u00e9e. Discard the seeds. Sweeten the pur\u00e9e with the sugar to taste.",
        "Set six tall glasses or tumblers on a tray. Put a spoonful of the whipped cream and whisky mixture in the base of each glass. Sprinkle half of the oats and almonds and half the whole raspberries on top.",
        "Drizzle over half of the raspberry pur\u00e9e. Repeat the layers once more. Keep the layers as loose as possible. You can assemble all the ingredients well ahead of time but make sure you serve the puddings as soon as they are layered."
