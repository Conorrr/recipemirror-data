        "For the lamb\u2019s livers, dust the livers in flour. Gently fry the livers in oil for a minute or two. Add the butter, turn the livers over and season with salt. When cooked to your liking, remove from the pan and set aside to rest.",
        "For the sauce, melt the butter in a pan until foaming. Add the shallot and fry until soft and translucent. Deglaze the pan with the sherry vinegar and reduced lamb stock. Bring to the boil and add a dash of cream. Season, to taste, with salt, pepper and lemon juice. Pour the sauce over the livers.",
        "For the peas, blanch the peas in boiling, salted water for 20 seconds. Refresh in ice-cold water and drain well.",
        "Heat a saut\u00e9 pan and add the butter and a little water. Add the peas, lettuce leaves, mint, spring onions and baby breakfast radishes and toss together. Season with salt and pepper and lemon juice.",
        "For the Mayan Gold potatoes, bring a pan of salted water to the boil. Add the potatoes and cook gently until tender. Drain and allow them to steam off slightly. Pass the potatoes through a potato ricer (or mash), gently fold in the boiled milk and butter until smooth. Keep warm until ready to serve.",
        "To serve, divide the pea salad between four bowls. Place a large quenelle of potato pur\u00e9e alongside the salad and place the lamb\u2019s liver on top of the pur\u00e9e. Drizzle the sauce all over."
