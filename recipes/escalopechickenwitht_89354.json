        "Preheat the oven to 180C/350F/Gas 4.",
        "For the chicken, rub the oil into the meat and season well with salt and freshly ground black pepper.",
        "Heat a small amount of oil in a griddle pan over a high heat. Add the chicken and fry for 2-3 minutes to brown it, then transfer to the oven for 6-7 minutes to cook the chicken through.",
        "For the potatoes, melt the butter in a small, ovenproof frying pan, then remove from the heat.",
        "Add the potato slices to the pan one by one to form a layer. Season well with salt and freshly ground black pepper, and transfer to the oven for 7-8 minutes.",
        "Remove the pan from the oven and turn the potato slices over, then return the pan to the oven and cook the potatoes for a further 5-7 minutes, or until cooked through.",
        "For the sweet and sour roast tomatoes, press the flat sides of the tomato halves onto a floured work surface so that they are coated with flour.",
        "Heat the oil in an ovenproof saucepan over a medium heat, add the tomatoes, flat sides down, and fry for 3-4 minutes.",
        "Sprinkle the tomatoes with the sugar and balsamic vinegar, then place the pan into the oven to roast for 6-8 minutes.",
        "For the ketchup vinaigrette, heat the wine vinegar and ketchup in a separate saucepan over a medium heat for 5-6 minutes. Stir in the chopped fresh herbs and remove from the heat.",
        "To serve, place the chicken strips onto a plate with the potatoes and tomatoes, and drizzle with the vinaigrette."
