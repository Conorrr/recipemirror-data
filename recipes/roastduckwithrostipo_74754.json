    "steps": [
        "To make the sauce, place the sugar and rhubarb in a medium-sized pan and cook over a low-to-medium heat for five minutes.",
        "Add the red port and bring to the boil for two minutes.",
        "Add the chicken stock and cook until rhubarb resembles a sauce.",
        "Preheat oven to 180C/356F/Gas 4.",
        "To make the r\u00f6sti, begin by par-boiling the potatoes for about 10-15 minutes. This will help the r\u00f6sti to cook through more quickly. Cool until you're able to handle them.",
        "Once cooled, using a grater, finely grate the potato. Sprinkle the potato with salt and place in a large tea towel or cloth. Squeeze firmly and discard the moisture that comes from the potatoes through the cloth.",
        "Mix thyme leaves with potato and place in a small blini pan, about 2-3cm/1in in depth.",
        "Using plenty of oil, cook r\u00f6sti potato on a medium heat until golden brown on one side.",
        "While r\u00f6sti potato is cooking, constantly push the potato down using a fork.",
        "Turn r\u00f6sti and continue to colour until golden on both sides. NB: R\u00f6sti potatoes can be made in advance and reheated just before serving.",
        "For the duck, on a medium-to-high heat, place duck breasts in a frying pan skin-side down and cook until skin is a light golden brown.",
        "Place duck breasts in the oven for 8-12 minutes while continuing to check from time to time that the skin of the duck does not become too dark.",
        "Remove duck from oven and rest for 4-5 minutes.",
        "In a separate pan, saut\u00e9 spinach in a little butter until soft.",
        "Using the back of a slotted spoon, squeeze excess moisture out of spinach (discard) and keep spinach warm.",
        "Place spinach and potato on serving plate, slice duck and arrange in a fan shape around the spinach and potato.",
        "Drizzle sauce around the plate and serve."
