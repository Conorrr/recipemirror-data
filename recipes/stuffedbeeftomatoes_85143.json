        "Preheat the oven to 180C/355F/Gas 4.",
        "Cut the top off the beef tomato and scoop out the seeds and the loose core with a teaspoon. Discard the seeds and core. Place the tomatoes onto a baking sheet, season well with salt and freshly ground black pepper, drizzle with olive oil and transfer to the oven to heat through for five minutes.",
        "Meanwhile, combine the breadcrumbs, flaked almonds, parsley, garlic and melted butter in a bowl.",
        "Remove the tomatoes from the oven and stuff each with equal amounts of the stuffing mixture. Drizzle with more oil and return to the oven to cook for five more minutes, or until the stuffing is heated through.",
        "Serve each stuffed tomato on a plate with a bed of fresh herb salad with dressed with vinaigrette of your choice."
