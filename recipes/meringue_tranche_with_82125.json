Top with your favourite fruits. Equipment and preparation: you will need a plastic piping bag and an electric whisk.",

            "4 free-range egg whites",
            "225g/8oz caster sugar",
            "300ml/\u00bd pint pouring double cream",
            "200g/7fl oz full-fat Greek yoghurt",
            "900g/2lb raspberries and blueberries",

    "steps": [
        "Preheat the oven to 120C/250F/Gas \u00bd. Line a large baking tray with non-stick baking parchment. Mark two rectangles 12x40cm/4\u00bdx16in long on the parchment in pencil and turn the paper over.",
        "Place the egg whites in a spotlessly clean bowl and whisk with an electric whisk until they form stiff peaks when the whisk is removed from the bowl. Continue whisking as you add the sugar, one teaspoonful at a time, until all the sugar is incorporated. The meringue will then become shiny and will hold stiff peaks when the whisk is lifted from the bowl.",
        "Place the mixture in a large plastic piping bag and snip 1cm/\u00bdin off the end. Pipe the meringue into the rectangle shapes on the paper, then pipe little blobs along the long sides on top to make a rim. Or if liked, spread the meringue into the rectangular shapes.",
        "Bake for 1\u00bd-2 hours, or until the meringue can be lifted easily off the paper without sticking. Turn off the oven, leave the door ajar and leave until the meringues are cold.",
        "Just before serving, whip the cream in a bowl until it just holds its shape. Fold in the yoghurt. Spread the cream mixture onto the meringues and top with alternate raspberries and blueberries. Dust with icing sugar."
