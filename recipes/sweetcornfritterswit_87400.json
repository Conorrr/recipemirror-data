        "For the fritters, mix the flour, baking powder, salt and freshly ground black pepper, paprika and caster sugar together in a bowl.",
        "In a separate bowl, beat the eggs and milk together. Gradually add the egg and milk mixture to the dry ingredients and combine to form a batter.",
        "Place the sweetcorn kernels and spring onions into a separate bowl and add just enough batter to the mix to bind them.",
        "Heat the oil in a frying pan, and drop in a good spoonful of the mix. Cook for two minutes on each side, drain on kitchen paper and keep warm until all the batter is used up.",
        "For the tomato ketchup, heat the oil in the pan and gently fry the vegetables and spices until tender.",
        "Add the tomatoes and water and bring to the boil, then simmer for 20 minutes and season well with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Allow to cool slightly.",
        "Remove the cloves and blend the mixture in a food processor. Pass through a fine sieve, and then pass through again if the sauce isn't smooth enough.",
        "In a non-reactive pan, boil together the sugar and vinegar to form a syrup. Add the sauce and cook for about 12-13 minutes until it reaches the consistency of ketchup."
