    "steps": [
        "Preheat the oven to 200C/400F/Gas 6.",
        "Heat the oil in a deep, heavy-bottomed saucepan until a breadcrumb sizzles and turns brown when dropped into it. (CAUTION: hot oil can be dangerous. Do not leave unattended.)",
        "Heat the olive oil in a frying pan and fry the salmon and mushrooms for seven minutes. Season, to taste, with salt and freshly ground black pepper and leave to cool slightly.",
        "Brush a filo sheet with butter, then lay another sheet on top and brush with melted butter. Repeat with the remaining two filo sheets.",
        "Place the salmon mixture into the middle of the filo sheets. Fold in the sides, then roll up as a spring roll.",
        "Carefully add the spring roll to the hot vegetable oil and deep-fry for four minutes, turning over occasionally with metal tongs to ensure even cooking. When golden and crisp, remove with a slotted spoon and drain on kitchen paper.",
        "For the cherry ketchup, place the cherry tomatoes, oil and balsamic vinegar into a saucepan and bring to the boil. Cook for 5-6 minutes to reduce, until thickened.",
        "For the pastry cup, brush the two filo sheets with butter and place the layers into a ramekin. Bake in the oven for five minutes, or until crisp and golden. Remove from the oven and release the pastry cup from the ramekin.",
        "For the pesto, mix the basil and olive oil in a clean bowl and season, to taste, with salt and freshly ground black pepper.",
        "To serve, place the spring roll onto a plate. Fill the filo cup with the cherry tomato ketchup and place alongside the spring roll and drizzle the basil oil around."
