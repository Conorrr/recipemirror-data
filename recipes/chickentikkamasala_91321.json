        "Slice the chicken breasts into very thin slices and heat the oil in a large frying pan. Once the oil is smoking, add the chicken, onions and garlic and fry for 30 seconds over a fierce heat. Immediately add the ginger, chilli powder, turmeric, coriander and cumin and fry for a further minute.",
        "Stir in the tomato pur\u00e9e and the chopped tomatoes and boil rapidly for five minutes. Allow to cool slightly.",
        "Add the yoghurt and double cream. Return to a low heat, bring to a simmer and then stir in the salt and lime juice. If the curry is too thick at this stage you can add a little water (or chicken stock) to get the correct consistency.",
