        "Turn on to a floured work surface and knead very lightly. Pat out to a round 2cm/\u00bein thick. Use a 5cm/2in cutter to stamp out rounds and place on a baking sheet. Lightly knead together the rest of the dough and stamp out more scones to use it all up.",
        "Brush the tops of the scones with the beaten egg. Bake for 12-15 minutes until well risen and golden.",
        "Cool on a wire rack and serve with butter and good jam and maybe some clotted cream."
