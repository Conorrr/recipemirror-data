        "Preheat the oven to 180C/350F/Gas 4.",
        "Cream the butter and sugar together in a bowl until pale and fluffy, then gradually beat in the eggs. Mix in the flour, until the mixture is smooth.",
        "Grease a metal chefs' ring, place on a baking tray and spoon in the cake mixture. Scatter over two-thirds of the chopped prunes and gently press down. Bake in the oven for 10-12 minutes, or until the cake is golden-brown and firm to the touch.",
        "Turn the cake out onto a serving plate. Serve with the remaining chopped prunes scattered over, topped with a dollop of whipped cream. Dust with icing sugar and drizzle over the maple syrup."
