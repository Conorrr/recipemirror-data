        "Jill Dupleix was born on a sheep farm in Australia, and worked as an advertising copywriter for eight years before combining her two great loves - writing and food. Her illustrious career in food journalism included stints at various high-profile Australian newspapers and The Times in Britain.",
        "She has written several cookery books, some of which have been co-authored with her husband Terry Durack, the former restaurant critic for the Independent on Sunday. Jill and Terry lived in London's Notting Hill for several years, though the pair have since returned to Sydney. Jill\u2019s recipes reflect a passion for simple, fresh flavours and span all cuisines."
