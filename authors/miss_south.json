    "about": [
        "Originally from Belfast, but now living in Brixton, London, Miss South is a self-taught cook. She arrived at recipe writing via an unexpected route of chronic illness, daytime television, homelessness, benefits and blogging.",
        "Passionate about encouraging people about food and cooking, rather than telling them what to do, she enjoys the challenge of cooking on a small budget. She does not, however, enjoy the washing up that goes with it, so was delighted to discover the slow cooker.",
        "In 2014 she published her first recipe book, Slow Cooked, which is dedicated to economical and adventurous recipes for slow cookers. Miss South blogs primarily at North/South Food alongside her brother, Mister North. She is also the food and drink editor at the Brixton Blog. Her work has appeared in Observer Food Monthly and been featured on Radio 4\u2019s The Food Programme. She also edited Recipes from Brixton Village and was awarded joint winner for the Young British Foodies Fresh Voices in Foodwriting Award 2013.",
