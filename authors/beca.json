        "Beca appeared in series 4 of the Great British Bake Off.",
        "Her baking combines traditional family recipes with her own clever twists on flavours. Originally from Wales, Beca now lives in Hampshire. She bakes for her family, for her husband\u2019s regiment and for her local Military Wives\u2019 Choir of which she is a member. She has perfected macaroons, but above all she loves to bake bread because it is so versatile."
