    "about": [
        "Born in Delhi, Madhur Jaffrey came to London aged 19 to study drama at RADA and pursue her passion for acting. It was here that she learnt to cook, effectively by correspondence: while in London, she desperately missed home-cooked food, so her mother would send her recipes.",
        "Madhur acted in TV, film and radio productions in England, then headed to New York, where she wrote food articles to supplement her income and fund her children\u2019s education. This foray into food writing led to hugely successful books and accompanying TV programmes, made popular due to Madhur\u2019s straight-talking approach."
