    "about": [
        "Allegra was only 17 when her mother died, and it was then that she began cooking in earnest, taking on responsibility for putting dinner on the family table. She enjoyed experimenting with dishes, and it was her father who suggested she turn her love for cooking and people into a career.",
        "Allegra completed her classical French training at the Cordon Bleu School in London in 1991 and worked at restaurants around London, most notably The River Caf\u00e9, where she was promoted to head chef aged 24. Stints in San Francisco and New York followed.",
        "However, Allegra became disillusioned with cooking \u2018posh food for rich people\u2019 while working at Robert De Niro\u2019s Tribeca Grill. Upon returning to London, she ran a community centre caf\u00e9 and eventually founded Leon, an affordable healthy fast-food restaurant that opened its first outlet in London in 2004.",
