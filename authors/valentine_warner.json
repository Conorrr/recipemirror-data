    ],
    "about": [
        "Valentine Warner grew up on a farm in Dorset, learning to fish, shoot and cook from a young age. He studied an art foundation course in Bath before heading to London to train as a portrait painter at the Byam Shaw School of Art. Valentine enjoyed a \"reasonably successful\" career as a painter, but, at 23, couldn't resist the call of the kitchen and decided to focus his time on cooking instead of painting.",
        "His first job was at the Halycon restaurant in London; for the next five years he brushed up on his cookery skills, working under chefs including Alastair Little and Rose Carrarini."
