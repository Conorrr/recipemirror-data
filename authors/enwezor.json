    "about": [
        "Enwezor appeared in the 2014 series of the Great British Bake Off.",
        "Born and bred in North London near Harrow, Enwezor grew up in a family that liked to cook. He has taught himself to bake in the last three years and it has rapidly become one of his greatest passions, with him even doing a night shift with a professional baker, making over 900 loaves of bread, just for the work experience.",
        "Enwezor regards baking as an inclusive and fun activity that he likes to do with his children - he'll give them a bowl of flour and let them mix it on the floor whilst he bakes. Although he started off with bread, pastry is now his favourite thing to work with.",
        "Not wanting to run out of staple ingredients, Enwezor has been known to stock up his fridge with eight packs of butter at a time. He runs a group for amateur bakers in Portsmouth, sharing ideas and tips he\u2019s discovered, and he thinks baking in this way brings together the community.",
