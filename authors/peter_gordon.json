        "New Zealand-born Peter Gordon is renowned as a leading light of the Antipodean East-West 'fusion' style of cookery.

        "Peter rode into London on the success of his stint as head chef at New Zealand\u2019s original Sugar Club. When the restaurant branched out to Notting Hill, Peter was appointed head chef and the restaurant picked up a Time Out award only a year later.",
        "in 1999, Peter set up London\u2019s Providores and Tapa Room to critical and public acclaim, as well as launching the charity event Who's Cooking Dinner? in aid of leukaemia research. He is involved in restaurants in Auckland, London, Istanbul and New York, either as a consultant chef or co-owner, and leads various cooking demonstrations."
