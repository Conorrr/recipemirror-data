        "Jo' Pratt"
    ],
    "about": [
        "Jo is a television cook and author of three books - The Nation\u2019s Favourite Food, In the Mood for Food and In the Mood for Entertaining. She started her food career when studying Home Economics at John Moore\u2019s University in Liverpool.",
        "After graduating, she worked with big name chefs such as Gordon Ramsay, Jamie Oliver and John Torode on everything from live cookery demonstrations to television programmes such as Hell's Kitchen. However, her most enduring working relationship was with Gary Rhodes - for over ten years Jo worked on nearly all Gary's books and TV programmes.",
        "Jo\u2019s cooking style has come from working with those big chefs to create the most delicious food \u2013 and translating those ideas into recipes for the everyday kitchen. She branched out and tried some of her own ideas, which have led to writing her own books, features and appearing on TV shows in front of camera, rather than behind the scenes!",
        "She is the former food editor for both Elle and Glamour Magazine and was named one of Waterstone\u2019s \u2018writers of the future\u2019 in 2008."
