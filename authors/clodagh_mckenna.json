    "about": [
        "Between the ages of 10 and 18, Clodagh spent all her summers with a French family, for whom food was very important. At home in Ireland, her dad did all the cooking and would delegate the preparation jobs to Clodagh.",
        "Following her training at the Ballymaloe Cookery School in Cork, Clodagh spent three years as a chef in Ballymaloe House. At the weekends, she set up her own stall at the Middleton Farmers' Market, selling fresh pasta, p\u00e2t\u00e9 and pickles. Clodagh\u2019s work at the market sparked her dedication to the Slow Food movement; she has run events for the organisation and remains a staunch supporter of local artisan producers.",
