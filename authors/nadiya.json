    "about": [
        "Born in Luton to a Bangladeshi family, Nadiya has been baking for 10 years. She now lives in Leeds with her husband and is a full-time mum to their three children.",
        "After wondering why her father only served ice cream for dessert at his restaurant, as desserts aren\u2019t a big feature of mealtimes in Bangladesh, Nadiya was encouraged by a school home economics teacher to develop her skills and now delivers beautiful masterpieces at family occasions.",
        "Having put her career on the backburner to raise her family and with their support, she now feels inspired to have her own adventure - and make them proud."
