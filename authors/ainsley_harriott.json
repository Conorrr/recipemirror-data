    "about": [
        "Ainsley Harriott is the charismatic, larger-than-life presenter of BBC Two's Ready Steady Cook, who has become known for his flamboyant style.",
        "Ainsley trained as a chef at 16, graduating to commis chef, but his TV career started away from the kitchen: once he finished his chefs' training, he toured Europe as part of a musical duo, The Calypso Twins. It was a turn that earned him several TV credits, a record release and a prominent position on London's comedy circuit. However, cooking remained Ainsley's first love, so he resumed his career in top hotels and gained experience in all aspects of the craft."
