    "about": [
        "Colin was born in Zambia to Irish and Scottish parents, and at age six moved to Abu Dhabi. He came to England when he was awarded a place at Bournemouth College to study catering.",
        "On completion of his course, Colin took his first post at the two-Michelin starred Domaines Haut De Loir in France, which he found challenging but learnt a great deal from. Then he made an elaborate career move by relocating to Abu Dhabi to work as banqueting manager for the UAE royal family.",
        "Colin returned to England and in 2001 bought the Woolpack Country Inn which he successfully ran as a family venture with his sister. Using business skills honed at the Woolpack Inn, Colin then went on to buy Winteringham Fields at the age of 27, a fine dining restaurant with rooms that has won many accolades including five AA stars, 2 AA Rosettes and 5/10 in the Good Food Guide.",
        "Colin\u2019s cooking style can be described as very natural; using simple ingredients and making them shine through in every recipe. He uses his own techniques and by his own admission says that a lot of it is trial and error, but his background in fine dining ensures he doesn\u2019t give up until he\u2019s reached perfection."
