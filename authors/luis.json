    "about": [
        "Luis was a finalist in the 2014 series of the Great British Bake Off.",
        "He was born and raised in Stockport, but both his parents are Spanish. This had a huge influence on his upbringing and meant he was fluent in Spanish from an early age.",
        "His wife gave him his first beehive as a birthday present and thereafter his passion escalated \u2013 Luis currently keeps eight hives: four at home, three at his allotment, and one at his caravan site. He uses honey from his bees and fresh ingredients from his allotment in his baking. He also preserves his own jam and his Bakewell tarts are his favourite bake to make... and eat.",
        "Smiley and affable but extremely focused, anything Luis sets his mind to he accomplishes. An extremely inventive baker, Luis produces thoroughly researched and unique bakes, such as his tequila slammer cheesecake or cherry brandy pipette gateaux.",
