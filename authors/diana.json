    "about": [
        "Diana appeared in the 2014 series of the Great British Bake Off.",
        "She is The Great British Bake Off\u2019s oldest baker so far and is armed with a quick wit and sense of seeing the brighter side of life. The daughter of a dairy farmer, she grew up on a farm in Shropshire on the Welsh borders where she joined the Women's Institute at the age of just 13 and became a Women's Institute judge at just 20 years old.",
        "Diana learnt to bake with her mother and grandmother from when she was just knee high. She is a traditional baker who has a strong base of knowledge to call on, and is confident making pies, pastries and cakes, but feels that baking bread may be her weakest area.",
        "Diana can whip something together from the odds and ends she finds lying around in the pantry in order to feed any unexpected visitors. Making her daughter\u2019s wedding cake was her proudest baking moment, but she describes her signature bakes as her chocolate cake, flaky pastry, Eccles cakes and vanilla slices.",
