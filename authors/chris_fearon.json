    "about": [
        "Belfast-based chef Chris Fearon is a proud Irishman out to prove that the food produced in Northern Ireland is as good, if not better, than anywhere in the UK.",
        "Chris started his career at college and, after receiving his basic training, he went to work at Nuremore Hotel (4 AA Rosettes) with Raymond McArdle, and worked there for two years. Chris was 18 or 19 at the time and was working with produce like wild bass, truffles, morels and ceps and he describes it as being a big eye opener. Chris moved to Shu in Belfast where he worked with Brian McCann. He left Shu to take up the head chef spot at Deanes at Queens.",
        "It was his love of food that inspired him to become a chef: \"what it actually comes down to is enjoying making people happy\"."
