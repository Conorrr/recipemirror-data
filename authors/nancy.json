    "about": [
        "Nancy won the 2014 series of the Great British Bake Off.",
        "Originally from Hull, Nancy moved to Lincolnshire 24 years ago for work. Now retired, she keeps active by cycling, growing vegetables, rearing guinea fowl and growing her own turkeys for Christmas in her back garden. Her children call it the 'Good Life\u2019.",
        "Nancy and her husband have renovated a house in the south of France and her time spent there has influenced her baking. She made friends with a French chef with whom she discusses ideas and learns new techniques, and pushed herself to improve her French so that she can read original French recipes.",
        "Nancy bakes to feed the family and reduce costs, but also prefers the taste of homemade baking. She wants to pass on her baking knowledge to her grandchildren and see them develop a passion for food and cooking. She loves to impart her knowledge to anyone who will take it, even teaching her hairdresser how to bake.",
