        "Andrew started his culinary training in France. Following his return to the UK, he went on to work with well-known chefs including Albert Roux and Anton Edelmann.",
        "Having learned from the masters, Andrew went on to develop the contemporary European 'grazing concept', which allows diners to sample up to ten smaller dishes rather than a traditional three-course meal. Since then, Andrew has worked at many top London hotel restaurants."
