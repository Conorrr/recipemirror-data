    "about": [
        "Marie was entered in for The Great British Bake Off by her daughter. Her children claim at one point when they were growing up their mum couldn\u2019t even boil an egg - so Marie\u2019s come a long way.",
        "The turning point came in her thirties when Marie moved to Paris with her family and was inspired by all the French Patisseries. She fell in love with baking, specialising in elaborate, show-stopping decorations. But Marie also likes simple baking too and makes bread so her grandchildren can have \u201cproper packed lunches\u201d."
