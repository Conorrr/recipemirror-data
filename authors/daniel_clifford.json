    "about": [
        "Originally from Canterbury, Daniel began his chef career in the early 90s, working in restaurants all around the UK, then spending a six month stint at a Michelin-starred restaurant in France. Upon his return, he worked under well-known chefs such as Marco Pierre-White. In 1998, Daniel took over Midsummer House in Cambridge and took it from strength to strength.",
        "Many of Daniel\u2019s dishes are influenced by his time in France. However, he uses this training to reinvent British classics made with local produce."
