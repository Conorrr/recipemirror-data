        "Galton Blackiston"
    ],
    "about": [
        "In 1979, Galton Blackiston set up a stall at Rye market selling his own range of homemade cakes, biscuits and preserves. The range became known as 'Galton\u2019s Goodies\u2019 and such was its success during that year that Galton abandoned plans to become a professional cricketer, deciding instead on a career as a chef.",
        "He promptly embarked on work experience placements in New York, Canada, South Africa and London.",
        "Galton shares his passion for Norfolk produce and simple, well-cooked dishes at Morston Hall, an 18th century brick-and-flint manor house which he restored and transformed into a hotel and restaurant in 1991."
