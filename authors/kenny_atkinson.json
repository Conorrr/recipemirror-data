    "about": [
        "Born and bred in Newcastle, Kenny Atkinson left school at 16 and fell into cooking after a stint working with his uncle in the kitchens of a local hotel.",
        "Once he\u2019d qualified as a chef, he went to cook in Greece, then worked his way up the ranks in kitchens around the UK. He quickly proved his worth, winning Michelin stars soon after joining restaurants in the Scilly Isles and County Durham. Kenny's heart is firmly rooted in the north-east: his classical British food with a modern twist champions locally sourced produce."
