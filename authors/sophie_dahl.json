    ],
    "about": [
        "Sophie Dahl grew up in the midst of a greedy extended family, whose members all loved to cook and eat. Despite building a successful modelling career, Sophie eventually left the catwalk and instead followed in her grandfather Roald\u2019s footsteps and dedicated herself to writing.",
        "After the success of both a novella and a full-length novel, Sophie published her first cookery book, Miss Dahl\u2019s Voluptuous Delights, in 2009. The recipes were inspired by Sophie\u2019s childhood memories and the travelling she did as a model. Some of the book\u2019s recipes were brought to the screen for BBC2\u2019s The Delicious Miss Dahl, broadcast the following year.",
        "Sophie lives in London and is a regular contributor to both fashion and food magazines."
