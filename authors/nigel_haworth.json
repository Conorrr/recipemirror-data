        "Nigel trained at Accrington and Rossendale Catering College in Lancashire. On leaving college, he worked at the Royal Berkshire in Ascot and the Grosvenor Hotel and The Ritz in London. In 1978 he began working in hotels in Switzerland, where he perfected his patisserie skills.

The restaurant was not well known at the time, but Nigel's hard work led to him being named Egon Ronay Chef of the Year in 1995. The following year, Nigel was awarded a Michelin star, which he has succeeded in retaining every year since.",

In 2004 he received the Prince Philip Medal, the City and Guilds' highest accolade, in recognition of his lifelong commitment to catering, and in 2006 he was awarded the Lifetime Achievement Award at the Northern Hospitality Awards."
