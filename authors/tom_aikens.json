    "about": [
        "Tom's early exposure to food and wine came from his father and grandfather, who were both wine merchants. Tom and his identical twin brother, Rob, both studied at Norwich City College Hotel School. At 22, Tom became chef de partie at Pierre Koffmann's legendary La Tante Claire in London.",
        "In 1993, he became sous chef at Pied \u00e0 Terre in London and then gained more Michelin experience at three-star level in France. In 1996 he returned Pied \u00e0 Terre and, aged just 26, became the youngest head chef to earn a second Michelin star. It was when Tom launched his eponymous restaurant in London in 2003 that he sealed his reputation as one of the most exciting young chefs in the UK. His second, more informal restaurant, Tom's Kitchen, was launched in October 2006. Tom has also written cookbooks.",
