    "about": [
        "Martha appeared in the 2014 series of the Great British Bake Off.",
        "She is the Great British Bake Off\u2019s youngest ever baker and, at just 17 years old, she combines baking with her AS Level exams and coursework, taking revision breaks to make a tower of profiteroles or a batch of macaroons.",
        "Martha\u2019s earliest baking memory is baking rock cakes and pizzas with her mum. Working on the cheese counter at a supermarket gives Martha inspiration to try different cheeses and flavours in her bakes.",
        "Martha is fascinated by the science of baking. She is determined to turn this fascination into a successful career as a food scientist and has bookcases full of recipe books that she reads cover to cover, tweaking and improving on the original recipes.",
        "Martha entered the Rotary Club\u2019s Young Chef of the Year competition in 2012 and won the first local heat as East Berkshire\u2019s Young Chef of the Year. She went on to achieve second place in the Thames Valley heat - despite having set her oven gloves on fire, causing the kitchen to be evacuated\u2026",
