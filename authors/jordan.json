    "about": [
        "Jordan appeared in the 2014 series of the Great British Bake Off.",
        "He lives in Nottingham where he works as an I.T. manager. The self-confessed \u2018nerdy baker\u2019 of the tent, when offered both an easy and a complex way to do something he will always go for the most difficult.",
        "Jordan is a baking revolutionary and is passionate about crossbreeding bakes such as his 'pretzel-croissant' - he has lost days of his life perfecting his own version of the 'cronut.' He has been baking seriously for the last three years but has dabbled for longer than that.",
        "He considers baking to be similar to coding, where one wrong instruction can cause the whole thing to go awry. He calls his pet sourdough starter \u2018Yorick the Yeast\u2019, who requires daily feeding to keep him happy and healthy."
