    "about": [
        "Angela Hartnett is one of the most high-profile female chefs in the world, having worked at many of London\u2019s top restaurants. During her childhood, Angela's Italian grandmother and mother instilled in her an appreciation and love of good food.",
        "Angela\u2019s first job was in Barbados; upon returning to the UK, she joined the young team at Aubergine, cooking under Gordon Ramsay. Angela proved her worth during a gruelling year, when she worked with a predominantly male brigade who had predicted she would last no more than a week. By the end of that year, Angela had seen the restaurant achieve its first Michelin star.",
        "Angela has since won numerous awards, and has paid real homage to her Italian roots by opening Murano, a fine-dining restaurant in London with an Italian-influenced menu. In January 2007, Angela was awarded an MBE for services to the industry."
