    "about": [
        "Claire appeared in the 2014 series of the Great British Bake Off.",
        "She has been baking since she was 11 years old. Both her mother and grandmother were wedding cake decorators and her father was a chef, so they all taught her crucial techniques that should come in handy for the Bake Off.",
        "Before marrying husband Carl, Claire used to be a chaotic baker, but her chemist husband's precision has greatly influenced her in the kitchen. She loves making cakes and pastries, particularly Chelsea buns, and her sense of fun and mischief shine through in her baking. She likes to decorate extravagantly with real attention to detail, always researching and playing around with different ingredients.",
