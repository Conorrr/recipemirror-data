    "about": [
        "Norman appeared on the 2014 series of the Great British Bake Off.",
        "He is a true Scot and lives on the north-east coast of Scotland. Now retired, Norman joined the Merchant Navy at the age of 19 where he worked as a radio operator and travelled the world.",
        "Norman\u2019s father and brother were bakers, but he didn\u2019t want that lifestyle for himself. However, he would like to bring back traditional Scottish recipes and has contacted some of his father\u2019s old apprentices to revive some of the more traditional Scottish bakes that he fears are being lost.",
        "Despite being fiercely Scottish, he takes his caravan to Perpignan in France and some of his baking is inspired by French patisserie. Norman cultivates his own yeast starters to make bread and also uses it to brew his own beer and wine.",
