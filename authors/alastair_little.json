    "about": [
        "Alastair Little's cookery has been a major catalyst in the evolution of modern British cuisine.",
        "As a boy, Alastair travelled widely across Europe because his father was a naval officer. His travels ignited his passion for food, although he didn't study cooking formally, preferring to read archaeology at Cambridge. After university, he returned to the kitchen and learned his trade at London venues, before setting up on his own, first with Suffolk restaurant Le Routier and then Simpsons in Putney. Alistair's eponymous restaurant, which he opened in Soho in 1985, soon became known as one of the great London eateries. It eventually closed in 2009."
