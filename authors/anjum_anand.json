        "Anjum Anand"
    ],
    "about": [
        "Through her cookery shows and books, Anjum has made Indian food more accessible to the British public.",
        "She has worked at restaurants in New York City, Los Angeles and New Delhi, but her preference for simple home-style cooking has seen her inject her extensive knowledge of traditional and regional Indian cooking into television work. Anjum is determined to change public perception of Indian cuisine as heavy and difficult to cook. She follows the Ayurvedic approach to food and well-being and applies its principles to her cooking, preferring to keep dishes light, fresh and healthy.",
