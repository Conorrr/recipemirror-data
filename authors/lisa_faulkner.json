    "about": [
        "Lisa started her career as an actress and has since become a successful cook. Although she won Celebrity MasterChef in 2010, Lisa hates people calling her a chef as she thinks that 'cook' and 'chef' are very different things. She is a home cook and a busy mum.",
        "When Lisa wrote her first recipe book, it in part was borne from her frustration of opening recipe books to find ingredients listed that she didn\u2019t have, or had to go to specialist shops to find. Lisa also believes that it is really important for recipes and cooking skills to be passed on from one family member to another."
