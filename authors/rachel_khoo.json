    "about": [
        "Croydon-born cook and food writer Rachel is a chef, a twice-published author and a self-confessed food creative. Her passion for food took her to the French capital some years ago where she trained at Le Cordon Bleu. She went on to open her own restaurant \u2013 the smallest in the city, with just two covers \u2013 in her Belleville flat, and it went down a storm with the notoriously tough French critics.",
        "Her unique take on French cooking \u2013 influenced by her Malay-Chinese-Austrian heritage \u2013 made her the perfect host to explore the city\u2019s finest food in her first cookery show, The Little Paris Kitchen, where she demystifies French food from her tiny Parisian studio apartment."
