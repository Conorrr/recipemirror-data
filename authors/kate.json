    "about": [
        "Kate appeared in the 2014 series of the Great British Bake Off.",
        "Originally from Cambridgeshire, Kate now lives in Brighton with her daughter. Community-minded, every year Kate organises a street party and she loves to bake for her family \u2013 last year she made 15 Christmas cakes!",
        "Sparky and full of beans, Kate is a creative baker and treats every bake as an experiment. She very rarely uses recipes or weighs ingredients. She once baked a life-sized Goldfinger Bond girl for her sister\u2019s 40th birthday and a full-sized 3D sculpture of her friend\u2019s head \u2013 all from cake.",
        "Kate feels that cake is her strongest area, with pastry being her weakest. She bakes with her daughter, but admits that she is a terrible delegator in the kitchen.",
