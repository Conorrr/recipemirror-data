    "about": [
        "At 19, Flora is the youngest baker in series six of the Great British Bake Off. An old head on young shoulders, Flora is an assistant at a contemporary art gallery while she waits to start her history of art degree.",
        "She lives at home with her parents and two younger sisters in the Scottish countryside, 20 minutes from the nearest shop. Because of the distance Flora always makes sure the larder and freezer is regularly stocked with ingredients, so she can bake cakes and loaves for the rest of her family.",
        "Flora comes from a big family of bakers and can\u2019t remember ever not baking, and with this in mind the standards have to be high to impress her harshest critics \u2013 her sisters."
