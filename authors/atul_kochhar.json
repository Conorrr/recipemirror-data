    ],
    "about": [
        "Born in Jamshedpur in eastern India, Atul began his cooking career in top hotel restaurants in India. In 1994 his talents took him to London, where he opened fine-dining Indian restaurant Tamarind in Mayfair.",
        "In 2001, at the age of 31, Atul became the first Indian chef to win a Michelin star. He has since opened several more Indian restaurants in the capital, that follow in the same vein as his previous fine-dining endeavours. Never complacent about the quality of his work, Atul returns to his homeland whenever possible to research new recipes and ingredients.",
