    "about": [
        "Ian lives in Cambridgeshire with his wife and two children. He is a travel photographer and has the honour of being the Dalai Lama\u2019s personal snapper when he visits the UK.",
        "In recent years Ian\u2019s become more of a househusband and while his wife heads to work he often spends his days making giant catapults and zip wires for his children to play with. He started baking six years ago because he wanted them to have fresh bread every day. Ian\u2019s passion for foraging and travelling the world means that he\u2019s never afraid to bake with an unusual discovery from his garden - or much further afield!"
